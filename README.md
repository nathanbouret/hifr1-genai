# HIFR1-GenAI Project

## About this project
Life Science â€“ CxO Trend Analysis for Business 

How to leverage Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs) techniques to leverage the knowledge of corpus and extract information we want. Using Generative AI to beat competitors. Trends are constantly appearing in research and industrialisation pipelines. Being an early actor means gaining an advantage in going to market and is good for finances, reputation.  Trends generally do not appear out of nowhere. With Generative AI, we are hoping to use machine learning algorithms to generate new trends from patterns found in our corpus. By analyzing vast amounts of data and documents, GenAI systems can automatically generate comprehensive trend reports, analysis summaries, and insightful correspondences. This empowers organizations to quickly identify emerging patterns, market shifts, and customer preferences, enabling them to make data-driven decisions and stay ahead of the competition. The application of generative AI in trend analysis not only saves time and effort but also ensures accuracy and consistency in capturing and interpreting trends. Ultimately, genAI offers the potential to revolutionize trend analysis, making it more efficient, scalable, and impactful for businesses across various industries.
