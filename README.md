## About this project

Companies spend millions of dollars trying to beat their competition by anticipating and maturing on innovative solutions. Those ideas usually do not come by themselves. Most companies use consultant firms in order to gain useful insights into the new business opportunities and trends (provide source), and if they don’t, or their services are not accurate, they risk on losing many opportunities. 

Those solutions are costly, and not easily available, at least not at THE CLICK of a button. 

This is where our solution fits in. It is the ideal solution for the busy CEO who just needs quick insights to make quick and informed decision, for the people in the legal department who need to keep up with the inevitable frequent changes in legislations, for the business analyst who hasn’t finished his slide deck and has to get quick bullet points in a rush.  

This is ChatCxO. 


## How to take advantage Generative AI ?

How to leverage Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs) techniques to leverage the knowledge of corpus and extract information we want. Using Generative AI to beat competitors. Trends are constantly appearing in research and industrialisation pipelines. Being an early actor means gaining an advantage in going to market and is good for finances, reputation.  Trends generally do not appear out of nowhere. With Generative AI, we are hoping to use machine learning algorithms to generate new trends from patterns found in our corpus. By analyzing vast amounts of data and documents, GenAI systems can automatically generate comprehensive trend reports, analysis summaries, and insightful correspondences. This empowers organizations to quickly identify emerging patterns, market shifts, and customer preferences, enabling them to make data-driven decisions and stay ahead of the competition. The application of generative AI in trend analysis not only saves time and effort but also ensures accuracy and consistency in capturing and interpreting trends. Ultimately, genAI offers the potential to revolutionize trend analysis, making it more efficient, scalable, and impactful for businesses across various industries.
