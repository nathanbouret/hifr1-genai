More recently, COVID paved the way for a massive \\n\\ninterest  in  data  and  AI  domain,  stakeholders  are  now  fully \\n\\nembracing it, learning and sometimes succeeding on their way.\\n\\nIn 2022, we are celebrating the 5th edition of the AI for Health Summit. 5-years \\nis quite young, but old enough to see changes in this fast-evolving industry \\nthat is catching up at such a speedy pace.\\n\\nAfter the success of the two first editions, we come back this year even stronger \\nto  report  on  where  healthcare  organizations  stand  in  their  data  and  AI \\njourney. We have extended our scope and we now cover Pharmas, MedTechs, \\nTech  providers,  Startups,  Hospitals,  Research  labs,  Insurance,  Patients \\nand Regulators. \\n\\nAs part of the “AI for Health Global Conference”, held on November 16, 2022, \\nthis  report  gathers  a  large  panel  of  140+  respondents  into  an  online  survey, \\nalong  with  22  deep-dive  interviews  with  field  change  makers  that  bring \\ntheir  expertise  in  the  domain.  We  have  reached  some  statistical  significance \\nand international stature. We would like to thank our panel for their precious \\ninsights.\\n\\nSimilar to 2021, the ambition of this work is to help stakeholders get more \\nfamiliar with data AI strategic stakes and main applications, get a grasp of the \\nindustry’s  level  of  maturity,  while  providing  them  with  insights  on  the  main \\nroadblocks, ethical considerations, and operating choices they may face in \\ntheir journey to implement data and AI use cases. This year, we also provide an \\n“how to guide” to reach the next level of data and AI literacy depending on your \\nprofile.\\n\\nWe take away from this edition that healthcare stakeholders are mid-way in \\ntheir  data  and  AI  journey,  at  the  crossroads  of  their  ambition.  They  are \\ngetting their hands dirty with concrete use case delivery, sometimes meeting \\nsuccess and often facing challenges.\\n\\n4\\n\\nHealth & AI: Now and Next    2022 edition\\n\\n\\x0cWe  built  this  report  as  a  reference  but  also  as  a  mind  shaker  of  this  rich \\necosystem,  that  works  more  and  more  all  together  around  an  overarching \\ncommon  goal:  delivering  the  best  possible  care  to  individual  patients  in \\ntheir diversity and to society as a whole, at an affordable and sustainable cost. \\n\\nWe reiterate our ambition to have this report fully leveraged to ensure patients, \\npractitioners and authorities get the most out of the on-going revolution of \\ndata and AI in healthcare. More than ever, we are on a mission to democratize \\na  topic  that  every  player  can  have  a  role  in,  either  coming  from  a  business \\nbackground, a technical background or simply as a citizen.\\n\\nMake no mistake! The wind of change is now blowing everywhere across this \\nindustry.\\n\\nWe hope you will enjoy reading and using this report as much as we appreciated \\nworking on it. \\n\\nJoin us in shaping the future of AI for Health!\\n\\nDamien\\nGromier\\nFounder \\n& CEO  \\n\\nCharlotte\\nPierron Perlès\\nEVP Global Head of Insights\\nfor Intelligent Industry\\n\\nStéphanie\\nTrang\\nVice President  \\nEurope  \\n\\nBarnabé\\nLecouteux\\nSenior Director Insights for  \\nIntelligent Industry, Life Sciences\\n\\nAI for Health\\n\\nCapgemini Invent Global\\n\\nAI for Health \\n\\nCapgemini Invent France\\n\\nWe would like to give a special thanks to the partners of \\n\\n®\\n\\nHealth & AI: Now and Next    2022 edition\\n\\n5\\n\\n\\x0cTable \\nof contents\\n\\nExecutive summary \\n\\nP.8-10\\n\\nObjectives, methodology \\nand panel \\n\\nP.11-17\\n\\nStudy Objectives \\n\\nMethodology \\n\\nStudy Panel \\n\\nP.11-12\\n\\nP.13-15\\n\\nP.16-17\\n\\n6\\n\\nHealth & AI: Now and Next    2022 edition\\n\\n\\x0cKey Learnings \\n\\nP.18-75\\n\\nAI Strategy and Operating Model \\n\\nAI Maturity and Use cases \\n\\nTechnological choices \\n\\nEthics and privacy \\n\\nP.18-35\\n\\nP.36-57\\n\\nP.58-67\\n\\nP.68-75\\n\\nKey AI topics: a panorama \\n\\nP.76-97\\n\\nPatient centricity: getting there? \\n\\nNext healthcare system paradigm \\n\\nFuture of R&D \\n\\nNext generation engagement \\n\\nConnected Health \\n\\nData foundations \\n\\nAI/Data acculturation \\n\\nRegulator’s viewpoint \\n\\nP.79-80\\n\\nP.81-82\\n\\nP.83-85\\n\\nP.86-87\\n\\nP.88-89\\n\\nP.90-93\\n\\nP.94-95\\n\\nP.96-97\\n\\nContributors  \\nand acknowledgements \\n\\nP.98-103\\n\\nHealth & AI: Now and Next    2022 edition\\n\\n7\\n\\n\\x0cExecutive Summary\\n\\nFirst, we notice a continuity of the trends observed back in 2021.\\n\\nData and AI are still considered as key by organizations, although employee \\nacculturation is lagging behind. While dedicated units to address the matter \\nare  being  deployed,  they  are  still  too  far  away  from  decision  to  drive  the \\nnecessary  impact.  Offering  the  best  patient  care  in  terms  of  outcome  and \\njourney remains the top priority especially for Hospitals. Resource-wise, data \\nscientists  and  data  engineers  are  still  the  most  requested  profiles  on  the \\nmarketplace.\\n\\nOn maturity, the overall perception of the panel remains a feeling of a medium \\nmaturity  level.  Data  availability  -  data  not  always  complete  nor  made \\naccessible - and data quality - data not perceived reliable enough - still prevail \\nas the key barriers for use cases industrialization.\\n\\nOrganizations are still on their way towards more robust data foundations. \\nData  transformation  and  most  importantly  data  interoperability  (in  and \\nout) especially when working in ecosystem, show great room for improvement. \\nData visualization and machine / deep learning are still the most commonly \\nused processing techniques. Quantum technology, although booming in terms \\nof hype especially for drug discovery, is still in its infancy.\\n\\nWhen it comes to ethics and privacy, privacy can now be considered as an area \\nwhere stakeholders master the regulatory space and systematically address it.\\n\\nAt the same time, new trends are emerging this year.\\n\\nThe remit of data and AI organizations in healthcare clearly focuses on mastering \\nthe roadmap and more and more managing the collection, qualification and \\nprioritization of use cases. Ecosystem plays have always been game-changing \\nin the sector to create value, and they now accelerate with Startups and Hospitals \\nat the forefront. As maturity for data profiles’ need evolves, organizations know \\nhow to split core vs non core resources, that they would tend to externalize.\\n\\nIf maturity flattens, the commitment taken on industrialization for the years \\nto come show a great level of ambition. We can be confident in this ambition \\nmaterializing, since more and more use cases are on in the pipelines. As more \\nstakeholders  are  engaged  in  those  use  cases,  it  can  go  with  a  difficulty  to \\nengage the business.\\n\\n8\\n\\nHealth & AI: Now and Next    2022 edition\\n\\n\\x0cAs for technical arbitration, we observe a progressive move to cloud from players \\nbeyond Startups, for whom this shift has always been a no brainer. Hospitals \\nand Research organizations are clearly accelerating there while Pharmas and \\nMedTechs,  that  are  more  advanced,  pursue  their  journey.  We  introduced  this \\nyear the topic of sustainability in the discussion: although not considered central \\n(yet), the dimension is gaining importance in decision-making.\\n\\nAs  for  ethics  and  privacy,  the  panel  echoes  the  call  for  greater  model \\nexplainability  especially  for  Hospitals  and  Research  organizations.  Finally, \\ndata sovereignty stands out as a growing concern in choices, reinforced by \\nthe context of growing political instability.\\n\\nWe propose a maturity pattern in this year barometer, where we address the \\n“how  to  reach  the  next  stage”  question.

There is an overall call for simplification and co-construction \\nso that regulation can be more supportive of the innovation effort of the whole \\nindustry.\\n\\n10 Health & AI: Now and Next    2022 edition\\n\\n\\x0cStudy\\nObjectives\\n\\nSCOPE AND INTENT OF THE 2022 EDITION «HEALTH & AI: NOW AND NEXT»\\n\\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) is defined as the attempt to replicate \\nhuman  cognitive  capabilities  through  advanced  technology, \\nand  to  reach  goals  in  an  autonomous  way  by  considering  the \\nconstraints and obstacles of the environment.\\n\\nHealthcare  is  defined  as  the  improvement  of  health  via \\nprevention,  diagnosis,  treatment,  amelioration  or  cure  of  disease, \\nillness, injury, and other physical and mental impairments in people.\\n\\nHealth & AI: Now and Next    2022 edition\\n\\n11\\n\\n\\x0cAI for Health refers here to data and AI issues aiming to transform the \\nhealthcare sector through the development and the deployment of use \\ncases.

In this section, we will \\n\\nsee how players are reinventing their business models to better \\naddress their users’ needs.\\n\\n\\x0c\\x0cAI STRATEGY\\n& OPERATING MODEL\\n\\nKEY TAKE-AWAYS\\n\\n1\\n\\nLevel of executive engagement\\n& acculturation\\n\\nIn  continuity  with  2021  and  reinforced  by  COVID  19,  AI  is  still \\nconsidered a key top topic by organizations (3.1/4). However, the \\nlevel  of  acculturation  of  C-level  executives  is  lagging,  especially \\nfor  organizations  that  would  need  it  the  most,  i.e.,  Pharmas/\\nMedTechs and Hospital.\\n\\n2\\n\\nAI leadership\\n\\nIn this dimension, we do not see major progress from 2021. Two \\nthirds of players have put a Data and AI organization in place, one \\npositioned at C-level but still away from Exco. Those departments, \\nwhen existing, will oversee the data and AI roadmap.They are also  \\nincreasingly  responsible  for  demand  management  process,  i.e., \\nthe process of collecting, qualifying, and prioritizing the use cases.\\n\\n3\\n\\nBusiness priorities\\n\\nEnhancing the Patient Care pathway and improving Care delivery \\nremain on the top of the organizations’ agenda. In particular, this \\nis  a  priority  for  Hospitals  and  Research  organizations.  Despite \\npatients  becoming  more  mature  on  their  access  to  qualitative \\nmedical information, patient information has a priority by only \\none third of the panel. \\n\\n20 AI STRATEGY AND OPERATING MODEL     Health & AI: Now and Next\\n\\n\\x0c4\\n\\nPartnerships and open innovation \\n\\nCollaboration  between  actors  is  very  frequent.  Two-third  of  the \\npanel  say they rely at least sometimes on partnerships to deliver \\nData  and  AI  use  cases.  Collaborations  are  split  between  business \\n(Academics  going  slightly  down,  Startups  going  up)  and  technical \\ncollaboration (Technology, IT & less frequently data). When adopting \\nopen innovation frameworks, Startups and Hospitals are the ones \\nthat contribute the most to the construction of the ecosystem.\\n\\n5\\n\\nFocus on Startups\\n\\nAs the main clients, big private companies (Pharmas/MedTechs) and \\nHospitals  come  first.  The  subscription  business  model  represents \\nhalf of the panel, Pay-as-you go comes second and freemium went up \\nby a factor of five from 2021. When selling digital products, Software \\nas a Service (SaaS) is still the main mode,  but  PaaS  (Platform  as  a \\nService) is catching up.\\n\\n6\\n\\nData profiles\\n\\nIn  line  with  2020  and  2021,  data  scientists  and  data  engineers \\nare  still  positioned  as  the  two  must-have  profiles  across  all \\norganizations. We see a shift in large organizations’ externalization \\nof more commoditized and non-core data profiles. As for Startups, \\nthey tend to integrate the full data management process in-house \\nas  their  core  differentiator.  In  particular,  they  need  high  profile-\\ndata scientists that are knowledgeable in both the domain (biology, \\npatient journey management, et cetera) and the techniques (Machine \\nLearning, NLP, quantum, and so on).\\n\\nHealth & AI: Now and Next     AI STRATEGY AND OPERATING MODEL\\n\\n21\\n\\n\\x0cLevel of Executive engagement \\nand Acculturation\\nReinforced by the COVID-19 crisis, AI is still recognized as a \\nstrategic priority by executives.

Hos-\\n\\npitals  seem  to  be  the  most  engaged  (3.3/4),  but  they  are  also  facing \\n\\ndifficulties in acculturating their staff at the same time.\\n\\nExecutives level of acculturation is intermediate\\n\\nThe level of acculturation of 2.6/4 can be considered intermediate, si-\\n\\nmilar to last year, which implies that the needle has not changed that \\n\\nmuch.  It  is  noteworthy  that  Hospitals  lag  behind  the  cohort  (2.4/4), \\n\\nwhile Research labs have accelerated their acculturation (2.8/4 vs 2.0/4 \\n\\nin 2021). On a positive note, we also notice a far higher engagement \\n\\nlevel in companies of more than 500 employees.\\n\\nEfforts are maintained to secure this acculturation\\n\\nDespite an intermediate level of AI acculturation, the initiatives deployed \\n\\nto  secure  knowledges  have  not  grown  (58%  in  2022  versus  57%  in \\n\\n2021), except for Research Labs (from 50% to 79%).\\n\\nHealth & AI: Now and Next     AI STRATEGY AND OPERATING MODEL\\n\\n23\\n\\n\\x0cAI leadership\\n\\nOn AI leadership, we do not see major progress vs 2021.

Research Labs have doubled their efforts, with \\n64% of respondents having a dedicated department (33% in 2021).\\n\\nThat  being  said,  such  departments  suffer  from  being  too  distant \\nfrom  Exco  -  across  most  of  the  organizations  that  are  below  500 \\nemployees.  In  most  cases,  Data  and  AI  departments  will  be  in \\nthe  hand  of  C-level  executives,  even  sometimes  under  C-level  in \\nPharmas/MedTechs.\\n\\nWhen such departments exist, they master roadmapping \\nand demand management \\n\\nData and AI roadmap and use cases demand management are part \\nof their key attributes.\\n\\nRoadmap  definition  and  steering  seem  to  be  the  starting  point, \\nrather  than  the  cornerstone  of  a  company’s  strategy.

This represents a \\n17-point increase from 2021. A positive correlation can be noticed \\nbetween  the  size  of  the  company  and  the  presence  of  a  demand \\nmanagement  process,  probably  to  deal  with  the  complexity  that \\ngoes with it.

It is a notion that patients themselves \\nhave created, as they want to have the industry refocused on their needs, \\ndrivers and behavior. Although the concept has been democratized in recent \\nyears and can sometimes be challenged, a lot remains to be done.\\n\\nPatient expectations\\nThese days, patients expect much more than medical \\nsupport  from  health  care  professionals.  They  expect \\nthem  to  be  considerate,  empathetic  and  really  care \\nfor  them  and  their  daily  life.  These  concerns  go  way \\nbeyond  their  disease  and  extend  to  their  personal \\nand  professional  lives.  They  would  like  to  be  mentally \\nsupported  in  what  they  are  going  through.  In  this \\nrespect, more than just information, patients ask for an \\nunderstanding of their personal situation, whether it \\nis the design of a clinical trial or the management of a \\nchronic disease.\\n\\nPatients  also  expect  their  care  pathway  to  be  less \\nfragmented.  They  want  to  be  able  to  access  the \\nright  care  service  when  they  need  it  the  most,  and \\nto  do  so  seamlessly.  Of  course,  patients  want  to  be \\nbetter  taken  care  of,  i.e.  to  have  access  to  the  best \\npossible  diagnostics,  treatments  and  services  on  the \\nmarket.  Finally,  care  affordability  is  also  a  key  issue, \\nparticularly for the most advanced diagnostic methods \\nor  treatments,  which  are  sometimes  not  fully  covered \\nby insurance policies.\\n\\nVirgine Rio\\nPresident\\n\\nBamp is the French \\nAssociation for medically \\nassisted reproduction. \\nWe provide  testimony, \\nreassurance and action! \\nIn that very personal \\nfield, patients are \\nlooking for quality \\ninformation, support in \\ntheir own journey, and \\ntransparency about \\nthe outcome.\\n\\nAdel Mebarki\\nCEO\\n\\nMain barriers & challenges\\nBeing patient centric is not an easy task. The first barrier \\nis having access to a representative panel of patients \\nto collect their feedback. This entails a profound change \\nin  the  way  organizations  and  the  system  operate, \\nmoving  from  a  doctor-centered  system  to  a  patient-\\ncentered paradigm.\\n\\nFrom our experience, the \\nfirst issue that comes up \\nfrom patients is a request \\nfor information. And 80% of \\npatient questions remain \\nunanswered to date!\\n\\nHealth & AI: Now and Next     KEY AI TOPICS: a panorama\\n\\n79\\n\\n\\x0cThat  being  said,  finding  the  right  balance  between  the \\nflexibility given to the patients in their care pathway and the \\nnecessary rigor required by protocols and prescriptions is a \\ncomplex topic.\\n\\nInitiatives to become more patient-centric\\nOrganizations are creating departments specifically dedicated \\nto patient centricity. Such departments would represent the \\nvoice of the patient, for instance when it comes to designing \\nclinical  trials.  Partnering  with  Patient  associations  is  also \\na  common  solution.  Some  advanced  organizations  would \\nincorporate patients or volunteers in the research process or \\nduring the (re)design of treatment protocols.\\n\\nHelping  patients  can  also  be  done  by  assisting  health  care \\nstaff  to  refocus  on  the  patient.  It  can  be  done  by  granting \\nsome  trainings,  providing  them  tools  to  ease  their  daily \\npractice or means to better communicate with patients. \\n\\nTrends for the coming years\\nParticipatory medicine is seen as a strong underlying trend \\nfor the years to come. Patients will become more and more \\nactive – and demanding - in their treatment.\\n\\nPatient data will be collected through different channels that \\nwill  encompass  multiple  aspects  of  the  patient’s  life  going \\nbeyond treatment endpoints (i.e. diet, physical activity, sleep, \\netc.),  serving  the  purpose  of  a  better  predictability  at  the \\npatient level. This data collection can be done via “non invasive” \\ndevices to secure a continuum of follow-ups, particularly for \\nfrail, elderly, or isolated patients. Thus, patients will be more \\naware of their health status and reach out to their healthcare \\nprofessionals outside of their medical visits. Patients will also \\nbe the owner of their health data and will decide with whom \\nand for what purpose they share it (or not). Blockchain could \\nalso  ensure  data  integrity  and  trackability  for  patients  and \\nhealthcare practitioners.\\n\\n80 KEY AI TOPICS: a panorama     Health & AI: Now and Next\\n\\n\\x0c\\u20092\\n\\nNEXT HEALTHCARE SYSTEM PARADIGM\\n\\nData and AI have the ability to deeply change the way care is delivered \\nto patients. It covers improving the quality of diagnosis, intervention \\nand treatments, improving care efficiency and smoothening complex \\npatient journeys inside and outside hospitals.\\n\\nA step-by-step adoption journey\\nThe  adoption  of  AI  within  Hospitals  is  taking  longer \\nthan anticipated. Players will start with data structuring \\nand retrieval first, before going into AI. In AI, the latest \\nprogress  is  concentrated  around  the  optimization \\nof  resources  (human,  financial,  equipment),  patient \\ninteractions,  and  screening  of  chronic  diseases  (e.g., \\nscreening for diabetic retinopathy). Although solutions \\nare coming, the value of AI remains to be demonstrated \\nat  scale  in  other  areas  such  as  prevention,  diagnosis, \\nand treatment.\\n\\nIn  addition  to  improving  patient  management  in  the \\nhospital,  AI  has  the  potential  to  greatly  improve  the \\npatient  journey  on  complex  care  pathways  involving \\nhospital,  general  practitioners,  lab  tests,  et  cetera. \\nDigital  tools  can  provide  continuity  of  care  outside  of \\nthe  hospitals’  walls.  We  talk  about  “phygital”  care.  The \\nbasis  remains  care  delivered  at  hospital,  but  with  the \\naddition  of  digital  solutions  to  an  eye  on  the  patients \\nand  detect  early  signs  of  a  condition  getting  worse. \\nIn  order  to  be  really  patient-centric,  the  system  also \\nneeds  to  be  caregiver-centric.  To  be  adopted,  digital \\ntools  need  to  propose  use  cases  that  provide  actual \\nbenefits to healthcare professionals as well.\\n\\nin \\n\\ninnovation \\n\\nFinally,  we  can  notice  some \\nthe \\nsustainability  space.  As  an  example,  a  tool  developed \\nby  the  CHUM  (Centre  Hospitalier  de  l’Université  de \\nMontréal)  calculates  the  costs  and  carbon  footprint  of \\nan operating room to make surgeons and their clinicians \\naware of the waste related to interventions. Costs saved \\nare then put back into the department for other missions \\nof the CHUM (e.g.: research, education, innovation).\\n\\nKathy Malas\\nDirector for \\nInnovation & AI\\n\\nMore than culture, we \\nneed funding, specialized \\nprofiles and a dedicated \\nteam to anchor data and \\nAI to the hospital.\\n\\nDorothée Moisy\\nInnovation \\nDirector\\n\\nTo generalize data and \\nIA, the innovations \\nshould be at the service \\nof the healthcare \\nprofessionals and  \\nsupport them on their \\ndaily practice.\\n\\nHealth & AI: Now and Next     KEY AI TOPICS: a panorama\\n\\n81\\n\\n\\x0cÁngel \\nAlberich-Bayarri \\nCEO\\n\\nThe biggest change \\nin the coming years \\nin AI for imaging is \\nto go from diagnosis \\nto prediction. To \\ndeliver that promise, \\nnew algorithms \\nshould be built and \\ndeployed around \\nclinical outcomes (e.g.: \\nsurvival, relapse, etc.).\\n\\nBut barriers to adoption remain\\nIn order to integrate data and AI within the Hospitals, it \\nis still difficult to bring all stakeholders around the table, \\nin  particular  doctors  and  nurses  due  to  the  little  time \\nthey can dedicate. A majority still lack prior knowledge \\non  the  fundamentals  of  data  and  AI  together  with  no \\nclear conviction on what it could benefit to their daily \\npractice.  They  definitely  need  to  be  convinced.  This \\nunderlines the importance of training on the matter in \\norder  to  reduce  fear  and  engage  them  in  the  design, \\ntesting and deployment of solutions. Funding could play \\ninto the equation, as arbitration would not necessarily \\ngo  in  favor  of  such  investment  over  other  priorities \\nin  the  context  of  inflation  in  Hospitals.  Finally,  at  the \\norganizational level, departments are still siloed, but it \\nis transversality that will accelerate the adoption. Such \\ntransversality can be brought by cross-functional teams \\nfully dedicated to the topic.\\n\\nWhich technologies are leveraged?\\nData is now well integrated into hospitals and leveraged \\nfor admin and care processes. Machine Learning is at \\nan  advanced  stage  with  some  use  cases  focused  on \\nprocess  optimization,  diagnosis  and  clinical  outcomes \\nimprovement. Deep Learning use is not well developed \\nyet, with the exception of imaging where algorithms are \\nembedded in PET Scan, MRI, CT etc... Other techniques \\nare  more  confidential  and  have  not  reached  the \\nscale-up  phase.  Natural  Language  Processing  has \\napplications  such  as  chatbots  or  document  scanning. \\nAugmented reality and the metaverse are still early in \\ntheir testing phase.\\n\\n82 KEY AI TOPICS: a panorama     Health & AI: Now and Next\\n\\n\\x0c\\u20093\\n\\nFUTURE OF R&D\\n\\nThe old era of multi-billion-dollar drug blockbusters is fading away, \\nresulting in a growing pressure on success rates, timelines and cost.\\n\\nPRIVATE R&D\\n\\nIn research\\nLeads identification and optimization can now be done \\nin  silico,  in  a  more  systematic  manner.

Connected  health  –  which  sits \\nat the intersection of digital and traditional care – is regularly discussed \\nas  a  way  to  harness  the  power  of  new  technology  to  improve \\npatient  engagement  and  health  outcomes.  Numerous  companies \\nhave taken up the topic, mostly major Pharmas, MedTechs and Startups. \\nConnected health is still in its infancy though, especially when it comes to \\ndemonstrating value.\\n\\nJeanne Kehren\\nSVP Digital & Commercial \\nInnovation & CIO\\n\\nDuring summer 2022, \\nBayer launched Calantic™, \\na digital solution to \\noptimize the workflow \\nexecution for the Imaging \\nHealth Care Professional \\nand help address radiology \\nindustry challenges.

But  both  approaches \\nimproving  the \\nserve  the  same  purpose: \\npatient  experience  and  care.  For  the  care \\nteams,  the  objective  is  to  support  them  in \\ntheir core mission: bringing the best possible \\ncare  to  their  patients.  This  may  involve \\nteleconsultation,  tools  that  allow  remote \\nmonitoring of patients suffering from chronic \\ndiseases or after surgery. There are also tools \\nwhose  objective  is  to  increase  productivity, \\ne.g.:  enhancing  the  throughout  in  radiology. \\nDown the line, the objective is to save precious \\ntime  for  practitioners.    As  for  the  patients, \\nconnected  health  spans  from  beyond  the \\npill  services  to  a  treatment  in  itself  (“digital \\ntherapeutics”).    Beyond  the  pill,  services  can \\nbe  education,  medical \\ninformation,  self-\\ntracking, and financial support.\\n\\nShort-term,  value-adding  solutions  are  more \\nfocused on treatment/monitoring. Medium to \\nlong term, use cases will more likely be focused \\non awareness/prevention and diagnosis.\\n\\n88 KEY AI TOPICS: a panorama     Health & AI: Now and Next\\n\\n\\x0cConnected health growth \\nstill has a long way to go before \\nreaching scale\\nIn  most  cases,  connected  health  does  not \\nreplace  the  expertise  in  diagnosis  and  follow-\\nup  of  a  doctor  or  the  intake  of  drugs  by \\npatients  that  have  already  proven  its  efficacy \\nand  safety.  It  comes  more  as  a  “companion” \\nsupporting  doctors  and  patients  along  the \\nway.    Value  created  would  in  many  cases  be \\nindirect.  Hence,  finding  connected  health \\nbusiness models is instrumental. Value drivers \\nhave therefore to be thought through from the \\nideation  phase  to  avoid  surprises  in  delivery. \\nAnother reason for the very gradual expansion \\nof  connected  health  solutions  is  the  difficulty \\nfor organizations to create an environment of \\ntrust around data collection. Connected health \\ncertainly  needs  data,  data  that  patients  can \\nbe  reluctant  to  give  from  a  privacy  protection \\nstandpoint  or  because  it  could  become  too \\ninvasive  in  their  daily  lives.  Finally,  we  can \\nmention  the  topic  of  reimbursement.

With no exception, all players on the panel recognize that data \\nfoundation is a key component in their future development but acknowledge that \\nthey have a long way to go.\\n\\nHow is data leveraged in \\nhealthcare?\\nWhen  designing  data  foundations,  it  is  important \\nto  consider  from  the  start  the  nature  of  data \\n(sensitive-/-non-sensitive,  complex-/-simple,  etc.). \\nThe players insist on the fact that data foundations \\nmust be built in parallel of their use cases to have \\nan  architecture  that  corresponds  to  the  needs  of \\nthe business at a given point in time. \\n\\nData used by healthcare organizations can be very \\ndiverse.  Indeed,  data  has  different  structures: \\nsome  data  is  structured  (e.g.,  IoT,  efficacy  and \\nsafety  date),  and  others  would  be  unstructured \\n(e.g.,  imaging,  voice,  social  network  data).  Data \\ncomes  from  different  sources  (clinical  trials, \\nmedical  records,  biological  data,  and  omics,  ...). \\nData  also  has  different  application  domains \\n(e.g.,  epidemiology,  clinical  trials,  marketing,  and \\nreimbursement).  Finally,  data  have  a  temporal \\ncharacter  and  must \\ntherefore  be  updated \\nfrequently. From there, we can easily understand \\nthe complexity of building and maintaining a solid \\ndata  foundation.  Without  a  proper  foundation, \\nthere is no possibility to scale use cases up.\\n\\nRomain Bey\\nHead of Data \\nScience Department\\n\\nThe data warehouse of \\nAPHP was first approved \\nin France, in 2017. From a \\nstrong backbone of patient \\nmedical records, we \\nhave built a marketplace \\nthat fed 200 projects \\napproved by our scientific \\ncommittee. The initiative \\neven has some impact on \\nday-to-day practice, for \\ninstance in data inputs or \\nadditional labeling that we \\ncan request.\\n\\n90 KEY AI TOPICS: a panorama     Health & AI: Now and Next\\n\\n\\x0cOrganizations are halfway through their journey\\nWe can consider data foundations as a 5-step cycle. The first step corresponds \\nto  the  implementation  of  processes  to  ensure  basics.  Organizations  that \\nexploit  data  have  all  built  such  processes.  The  second  step  of  the  cycle \\ncorresponds to data accessibility. It is about giving access to the right data \\nto the right actors through a convenient searchable experience. This can be \\ndone  by  creating  data  catalogs,  setting  up  data  compliance  and  ensuring \\ngood  data  security,  especially  for  personal  health  data.  Here  again,  the \\nplayers have generally put these procedures in place. The third step of the \\ncycle corresponds to the creation of a data platform (generally on the cloud, \\neven  though  some  players  would  still  prefer  it  to  stay  on-site)  that  allows \\nserviceable  data  usage  along  the  cycle  (ingestion,  storage,  transformation, \\nusage).  Most  small  and  medium-sized  companies  are  at  this  stage.  The \\nfourth step of the journey corresponds to the use of data « as a service »,  \\nnotably  through  data  products.  Only  the  most  advanced  companies,  such \\nas big Pharmas, are at this stage and are starting to create value from data, \\noften for internal use. Lastly, the fifth step corresponds to the use of data \\nto create value for third parties. Very few structures would be there. This is \\nalso where the healthcare Regulator could play their full role of orchestrator.\\n\\n3 TECH PLATFORM\\n\\nDATA PLATFORM & ARCHITECTURE\\n\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n\\nArchitecture Models\\nMove-to-cloud strategy\\nOperating model (incl. platform process & delivery)\\nTrusted Environmental Platform\\nIncl. articulation with Green IT\\n\\n2 ACCESSIBILITY\\n\\nDATA AUTHORIZATION & CATALOG\\n\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n\\n•\\n\\nData Classification\\nData Cataloging\\nData Compliance & \\nRight to Use\\nData Security & Privacy\\n\\n1 SETTING UP\\n\\nDATA GOVERNANCE & QUALITY\\n\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n\\nData Governance, Roles & Resp.\\nSemantic & Models\\nData Mesh / Data Fabrics\\nData Quality\\nData Management tooling strategy\\n\\n4 DATA AS A SERVICE\\n\\nDATA PRODUCTS AND SERVICES\\n\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n\\nData Products\\nData Awareness & Training at scale\\nData Architecture Services\\n\\n5\\n\\nDATA AS A BUSINESS\\n\\nDATA MARKETPLACE\\n\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n\\nTarget Operating Marketplace\\nData Sharing\\nOpen Data structure\\n\\nData mesh promise is to get value from data at scale in complex and large-scale organizations.

This regulation landscape would vary over time. \\nPrivacy (regulated by GDPR in the EU) is a top consideration, given the sensitivity \\nof healthcare data. We also see new areas of regulation popping up like AI and \\nsustainability.\\n\\nA complex regulatory framework…\\nFor most of the past decade, concerns about digital have focused on the potential \\nabuse and misuse of data. Those concerns led Regulators to create measures in \\nthe United States and European Union guaranteeing the user to have some level of \\ncontrol over their personal data (GDPR and Privacy Act). In addition to this privacy \\nconcern,  organizations  also  must  comply  with  regulations  regarding  products, \\nservices, and processes at every step of their value chain. Those regulations can \\nbe  national,  European  or  international.  This  makes  their  implementation  even \\nmore complex.\\n\\n… with AI now being reviewed\\nWhile the benefits of AI in healthcare is not to be proven, patients still need protection \\nfrom defective diagnoses, unacceptable use of personal data, and the elimination \\nof  bias  that  could  be  built-in  unintentionally  within  healthcare  algorithms.  As  an \\nanswer  to  this,  the  legal  framework  is  entering  a  new  phase.

(2)  \\n\\nThe Global Population is Aging \\n\\nOver the next three decades, the number of elderly people aged 65 or over \\nworldwide is projected to double to more than 1.5 billion people in 2050. As a \\nresult, chronic conditions are on the rise and patients are often suffering from \\nmore than just one ailment. 1 \\n\\nThis development is intensified due to the growing middle -class and increasing \\nadoption of sedentary lifestyles in emerging markets, leading to obesity, \\ndiabetes, and other costly health conditions. In China – the second largest \\npharmaceutical market globally – the proportion of the population aged 60 \\nyears and over will increase to 28% in 2040 (from 12.4% in 2010). 3 Chronic \\nnoncommunicable disease prevalence such as cardiovascular diseases or \\ncancer are expected to increase by at least 40% by 2030 and to account for \\nalmost 80% of all deaths in people aged 60 years or over. 3 \\n\\nShare of total population aged 65 years or over, by region, 1990 -2050 (1) \\n\\n  \\n \\n\\x0cA CAGR of 3-6 percent \\n\\nThe global pharma market remains attractive with an expected 3 -6% CAGR through \\n2025.

For patient care, digital solutions \\nenable the shift from a disease focus to an integrated approach from \\nprevention, screening, diagnostic, treatment and aftercare.  \\n\\nFurther, technological progress and new therapeutic approaches have the \\npotential to not only treat, but ultimately cure diseases – or identify and remove \\nrisk factors before a disease develops. Part of this development are \\npersonalized therapies, a promising approach tailoring medical treatment to the \\nindividual characteristics of each patient.

Today, Bayer is at the \\nforefront of exploring new therapeutic methods in this emerging growth market. \\nCell and gene therapies have the potential to revolutionize modern therapeutics \\nas they may offer the possibility to address the root cause of a disease. In cell \\ntherapy, functional cells are delivered into a patient’s body in order to prevent, \\nmanage or cure a certain illness or to repair and regenerate damaged cells. \\nGene therapy aims to treat or cure a disease by delivering genetic material  into \\na patient's cells. This way, cells which have been lacking the correct \\ninstructions to work properly, receive the genetic information that will allow \\nthem to restore their function. \\n\\n  \\n  \\n\\x0cBayer is strongly committed to leading the field of cell and gene therapie s. To \\nthis end, we are strengthening our internal capabilities while simultaneously \\npursuing external strategic collaborations, technology acquisitions and \\nlicensing across different therapeutic areas. Our newly established  Cell and \\nGene Therapy (C&GT) Platform strategically steers our efforts in the area. It \\nbrings the best of Biotech and Pharma together: The companies ope rate \\nautonomously and are fully accountable to develop and progress their portfolio \\nand technology. At the same time, Bayer provides them with the necessary \\nexperience and know-how across multiple stages of the entire value chain, for \\nexample for approval processes and commercialization to turn the science into \\ntangible products for patients. Our C&GT pipeline is comprised of eight \\nadvanced assets in different stages of clinical development and over 15 \\npreclinical candidates. 7 \\n\\nAmong the C&GT platform’s portfolio are the Bayer acquisitions BlueRock \\nTherapeutics and Asklepios BioPharmaceutica (AskBio) – both with promising \\napproaches for treating and potentially curing diseases with high unmet \\nmedical need. \\n\\nBlueRock Therapeutics is a leading engineered \\ncell therapy company working to develop regenerative medicines for intractable \\ndiseases. BlueRock’s technology seeks to restore tissue function in diseases \\n\\n \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n\\x0cwith significant cell loss and diminished self-repair potential, with an initial \\nfocus on neurological and cardiovascular conditions. \\n\\nBlueRock recently announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) \\nhas cleared their Investigational New Drug application to proceed with a Phase \\nI study in patients with advanced Parkinson’s disease – a big step forward for \\nthe stem cell field. \\n\\nAskBio is a biopharmaceutical company \\n\\nspecializing in the research, development and manufacturing of gene therapies \\nacross different therapeutic areas – Bayer’s newest addition to the C&GT \\nplatform. With a breakthrough technique developed by founder Dr. Richard \\nJude Samulski, AskBio uses a non-pathogenic virus as a vehicle to deliver \\nfunctional genes to cells. This approach aims at treating diseases on the \\nmolecular level and thereby fixing the underlying cause of the disease  – \\nleading to potentially life-changing therapeutics for patients. \\n\\nDid you know that Bayer is building \\na holistic digital health business? \\n\\nDigital technologies and the use of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and \\nbig data in pharma have the potential to transform the value chain – from drug \\ndiscovery to clinical decision making and ongoing patient management  – as \\nwell as evolving conventional healthcare approaches. \\n\\nAlready today, Bayer is set to tap into the potential of these technologies. \\nTogether with Blackford Analysis, Bayer is working on an AI platform for \\nmedical imaging, where digital applications will be made available to support \\nradiologists. One example for this is an AI powered software that assists \\nradiologists. One of such AI-powered applications is currently being developed \\ntogether with Merck & Co.. Using pattern recognition that is based on deep \\nlearning methodology, the algorithm helps detect chronic thromboembolic \\npulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) on CT scans and thereby aims at driving \\nearlier diagnosis and treatment improving outcomes for patients suffering from \\nthis severe disease.  \\n\\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n\\x0cThe opportunities to provide benefits to patients go beyond diagnosis. The \\ncombination of conventional healthcare approaches with digital technologies \\ncan make a real difference – especially in the context of integrated care, the \\ngeneral concept of taking a holistic approach to disease management. \\nLeveraging artificial intelligence, machine learning, and vast amounts of data, \\nintegrated care aims to help people regain control over their health through \\npredictive, proactive and personalized actionable insights delivered through \\ndigital applications. \\n\\nIntegrated Care is a key element of Bayer Pharma’s digital business strategy. \\nTogether with our partner, the digital health company Informed Data Systems, \\nInc (“One Drop”), we are jointly creating new digital health offerings that help \\npatients in the areas of cardiovascular disease, women’s health and oncology. \\nExperts from both companies are jointly working on the first two modules, \\nwhich are to become available within a year.

Global demand is \\ngrowing rapidly, and the unprecedented need  \\nfor COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics has put \\nadditional pressure on the industry. The industry’s \\nability to find innovative solutions to deliver  \\nCOVID-19 vaccines while still meeting overall demand \\nis a remarkable achievement, but rising global \\ndemand is still a significant challenge for the \\nindustry in the long term.\\n\\nExhibit 1\\n\\nThe pharma industry is facing a complex network of forces.\\nThe pharma industry is facing a complex network of forces.\\n\\nOperating environment\\n\\nGrowth enabler\\n\\nConstraint\\n\\nBoth\\n\\nActivities influencing\\nindustry\\n\\nWorkforce changes\\n\\nGlobal factors\\n\\nNew development\\n\\nNew work expectations\\nLabor market challenges\\n\\nGeopolitical\\nconsiderations\\nRising inflation\\nSupply chain disruptions\\n\\nAdvances in digital\\ntechnology and user\\nwillingness\\nEnvironmental, social, and\\ngovernance expectations\\n\\nPharma industry\\n\\nIndustry influencing\\nenvironment\\n\\nNew modalities\\n\\nPressure to innovate\\n\\nDiffusion of individual\\nplayers’ power\\n\\n2\\n\\nEmerging from disruption: The future of pharma operations strategy\\x0cThe pharma industry is facing a \\nmultitude of industry-specific and global \\ntrends. But a few major trends point  \\nto an industry tailwind; one of them is \\nthe advancement of digital and  \\nanalytics tools.\\n\\nThe product landscape also is changing swiftly.  \\nNew modalities, such as cell and gene therapy and \\nmRNA vaccine technology, have increased from  \\n11 to 21 percent of the drug development pipeline—\\nthe fastest growth ever seen in the sector. This \\nchange is likely to bring more fragmentation of \\ntechnology, new supply chains, and unique product \\nlife cycles. \\n\\nIn addition to these industry-specific trends, pharma \\nhas also been affected by broader global trends, \\nsuch as supply chain pressures. While the pharma \\nindustry is considered somewhat protected by its \\nhigh inventory levels and long-standing dual sourcing, \\nover a given ten-year period, the likelihood of supply \\nchain disruptions still represents a potential loss  \\nof 25 percent of EBITA. Inflation has risen in recent \\nmonths to levels not seen for decades, leading to \\nincreasing costs for labor, raw materials, and \\ntransportation. This is over and above the persistent \\nprice pressures pharma is already facing, particularly \\nin generics. Since pharma customers are not \\nexpected to fully absorb these cost increases, profit \\nmargins are under pressure.\\n\\nMeanwhile, increased state interventions and \\nprotectionist trade policies are creating new \\npressures on manufacturing networks and could \\ndrive increased regionalization. This would be  \\na capital-intensive exercise: to regionalize just  \\n10 percent of current vaccine trade in one particular \\ngeographical region, governments would need to \\ninvest an estimated $100 million.\\n\\nThe pharma industry is also facing talent shortages \\nlinked to wider labor market trends, including the  \\n20 percent increase in demand for STEM-related \\nroles across the life sciences industry in the United \\nStates. The current pool of pharma digital talent  \\nis at least 14 percent lower than demand, and many \\ncompanies are finding it challenging to recruit \\ntechnical talent. Compounding this challenge is the \\nrise of remote working, which has increased \\nemployee expectations for flexibility. In response, \\nnearly all pharmacos are experimenting with  \\nhybrid working models. \\n\\nA few major trends point to an industry tailwind; one \\nof them is the advancement of digital and analytics \\ntools. Digital tools, robots, and sensors are becoming \\ncheaper and easier to access, and they can be  \\nused to capture all manner of raw data. In addition, \\nedge computing and cloud analytics are providing \\nreal-time optimization and transparency. Pharmacos \\nare working to leverage the power of data to  \\nbecome more agile and resilient. However, to date, \\nno pharmaco has emerged as a true global leader  \\nin this field.\\n\\nEach of these global trends represents significant \\nchallenges in and of itself, and the trends may  \\nbe compounded and strengthened through their \\ninteractions. This compounding effect can  \\nadd to the complexity of evaluating an effective \\nstrategic response.\\n\\n3\\n\\nEmerging from disruption: The future of pharma operations strategy\\x0cMajor implications for pharma\\nThese global trends have six major implications for \\npharmacos: rising operational complexity, \\nincreasing risk, shifting capability requirements, \\nhigher capital expenditure requirements,  \\nvariable-cost increases, and opportunities for \\nsavings (Exhibit 2).\\n\\nFrom a cost perspective, the pharma industry may \\nsee significantly increased capital expenditure \\nrequirements related to the construction of new \\nsites and new digital infrastructure. Increases  \\nare also likely in variable costs in areas such as raw \\nmaterials, transportation, and employee attrition, \\nreskilling, and salaries.\\n\\nOperations leaders may need to become comfortable \\nnavigating a more complex ecosystem as they \\nrespond to increased operational complexity. Risks \\nmay increase due to rising environmental, social, \\nand governance (ESG) expectations and skills gaps, \\nwhile new modalities and digital acceleration will \\nalso likely lead to a shift in capability requirements. \\nThis could necessitate reskilling and upskilling of \\nstaff, as well as a renewed focus on recruiting from \\noutside of the pharma industry. \\n\\nAlthough these implications are challenging, they \\nmay represent possible opportunities for savings in \\nseveral areas. For example, ESG commitments  \\non waste reduction could reduce costs, as could \\nsuccessful digital implementation. However,  \\nthe challenge lies in monetizing these cost savings, \\ngiven that the industry has long created value  \\nlargely through revenue expansion rather than \\nthrough cost savings.\\n\\nExhibit 2\\n\\nCurrent pharmaceutical trends may add more cost, complexity, and risk, with \\nCurrent pharmaceutical trends may add more cost, complexity, and risk, with \\nthese forces compounding one another.\\nthese forces compounding one another.\\n\\nPharmaceutical industry trends and implications\\n\\nDegree of impact\\n\\nLow\\n\\nMedium\\n\\nHigh\\n\\nComplexity\\n\\nIncreased\\nrisk\\n\\nCapability\\n\\nCapital\\nexpenditure\\n\\nVariable-cost\\nincrease\\n\\nSavings\\nopportunity\\n\\nImplications\\n\\nTrends\\n\\nAdvances in digital technology\\nand user willingness\\nDiffusion of individual\\nplayers’ power\\nEnvironmental, social, and\\ngovernance expectations\\n\\nGeopolitical considerations\\n\\nLabor market challenges\\n\\nNew modalities\\n\\nNew work expectations\\n\\nPressure to innovate\\n\\nRising inflation\\n\\nSupply chain disruptions\\n\\n4\\n\\nEmerging from disruption: The future of pharma operations strategy\\x0cRising to the challenge: Actions to \\ndeliver value\\nTo respond to these challenges, pharmaco leaders \\nmay now need to emphasize the importance of their \\noperations strategy. They should consider taking  \\na longer-term view and scaling activity across four \\nkey themes: network strategy and resilience,  \\ndigital, operating model, and talent.\\n\\nExpand focus on longer-term,  \\ntransformative solutions\\nOperations leaders can address these challenges \\nthrough several short-term and long-term responses. \\nFor example, problems associated with a more \\nunpredictable supply chain could be addressed with \\na short-term approach of increasing inventory  \\nor a long-term initiative to establish an end-to-end \\nsupply chain digital nerve center.\\n\\nShort-term levers can be an important part of the \\ntotal response but are insufficient to fully mitigate the \\nchallenges facing the industry. To respond effectively, \\ncompanies may need to accelerate new ways of \\nworking and embrace long-term thinking. This will \\nrequire concrete action with a focus on making  \\nsure that strategies are put in place to weather the \\nlong-term headwinds the industry is facing.\\n\\nAccelerate and scale responses across four \\nstrategic domains\\nTo identify the actions that pharmacos could take,  \\nit may help to group these in terms of four strategic \\ndomains: network and resilience, digital strategy, \\noperating model and ecosystem, and talent strategy \\n(Exhibit 3). While these themes are likely to be \\nfamiliar to any business leader, they now require a \\nsubstantial shift in mindset. Acting on them also \\ncalls for a large investment of resources.\\n\\n1.  Plan for and manage future resilience and \\nreliability needs. Recent supply chain \\ndisruptions have pushed supply chain resilience \\nup corporate agendas. Companies have been \\nforced into reactive modes that employ short-\\nterm levers like building inventory. However, \\ncompanies could better position themselves  \\nby solving multiple variables and building \\nresilience into their operations strategy through \\nlonger-term actions like network design and  \\ndual sourcing.\\n\\n2.  Scale end-to-end adoption of digital and \\n\\nautomation. Digital has proven itself highly \\nvaluable to pharma operations. However,  \\nmany companies struggle to move from targeted,  \\n\\nExhibit 3\\n\\nMeeting pharmaceutical-industry challenges will mean recalibrating four \\nMeeting pharmaceutical-industry challenges will mean recalibrating four \\nstrategic responses.\\nstrategic responses.\\n\\nResponses, by strategic domain\\n\\nFrom\\n\\nTo\\n\\nNetwork and resilience Solving for cost; reactive and firefighting\\n\\nSolving for multiple variables; resilient, proactive,\\nagile, and fast to market\\n\\nDigital\\n\\nTargeted, single use cases\\n\\nFully scaled and ready for ecosystem leadership\\n\\nOperating model\\nand ecosystem\\n\\nTraditional hub configuration centered\\non originators\\n\\nEnd-to-end ecosystem of partners\\n\\nTalent\\n\\nHR-driven recruiting and training effort\\n\\nStrategic workforce planning; reskilling and\\nautomation\\n\\n5\\n\\nEmerging from disruption: The future of pharma operations strategy\\x0csingle use cases to a fully scaled suite of \\nsolutions. And while the adoption of full-scale \\ndigital solutions can require heavy investment—\\naround $50 million to $100 million per year  \\nfor two to three years—the rewards can include \\nsignificant cost savings, improved quality, and \\nincreased resilience, as well as greater employee \\neffectiveness. Companies that truly scale and \\nimplement digital can better protect themselves \\nfrom the pressures of the forces increasing costs \\nfor the industry. More and more companies are \\nmoving toward network-wide and end-to-end \\ndigitization; to date, the World Economic Forum \\nhas recognized 103 as “lighthouses,” based on \\ntheir advanced application of digital technologies. \\nJohnson & Johnson, for example, has successfully \\nlaunched multiple Industry 4.0 lighthouses, \\nincluding some focused on end-to-end patient \\nconnectivity and order fulfillment.\\n\\n3.  Expand adoption of end-to-end partner \\n\\necosystems. Companies could also consider \\nchanging their operating model from a traditional \\nhub configuration around originators to an  \\nend-to-end ecosystem of true strategic partners. \\nMore than 50 percent of companies already \\nexpect to intensify their collaboration models \\nwith other industry players through, for example, \\nservice agreements, joint ventures, or eco-\\nsystems. Some are already in motion; examples \\ninclude Pfizer and BioNTech, which have  \\nalready established a strategic partnership in \\nmRNA technology discovery, and AstraZeneca \\nand Huma, which are collaborating to scale \\ninnovation for digital health. These partnerships \\nare indicative of increasing collaborations \\nthroughout the industry across functions.\\n\\n4.  Embed talent strategy in operations strategy. \\nCompanies may also benefit from embedding \\nstrategic workforce planning into operations \\nstrategy, with a focus on reskilling, upskilling, \\nand automation. The shortage of talent may \\nmean shifting managers’ perception of strategic \\nworkforce planning—from “enabler” to a core \\n\\nelement of operations strategy. This could entail \\nmoving away from the traditional approach of \\nHR-driven recruiting and training and toward \\nplanning the workforce more strategically with \\nlong-term goals in mind.\\n\\nAutomation, centralization, and new job \\nrequirements may affect nearly 90 percent of \\ntoday’s workforce, and to deal with this \\nchallenge, companies could adopt effective \\nlong-term strategies. Retaining talent is \\nchallenging in the present environment, with  \\nthe share of workers planning to leave their  \\njobs in the next three to six months standing at \\n40 percent since 2021.1 Strategies for talent \\nretention should therefore be broad and focus \\non more than just salary.\\n\\nA viable long-term solution to talent shortages \\nmay need to involve more than increasing wages \\nto attract people. To solve structural talent gaps, \\ncompanies could ensure long-term reskilling and \\nupskilling of the existing workforce. For example, \\nRoche runs an operations rotational program  \\nto attract top talent with bachelor’s and master’s \\ndegrees, and early in the COVID-19 pandemic, \\nNovartis launched a “choice with responsibility” \\npolicy to improve overall employee experience.\\n\\nSuccessfully developing a robust operations strategy \\nis complex and requires dedicated resources with \\nthe ability to focus on the medium to long term.

At the same time, 2022 was another challenging \\nyear for society and the global economy.  \\n\\nRussia’s war of aggression against Ukraine, Covid-19, climate change, and geopolitical tensions are of profound \\nconcern to us at Merck. Against this backdrop, I am very proud that we continued to care, pioneer, and \\noutperform for our patients and customers while creating high impact across the Group for society as a whole. \\nMany of our colleagues across Germany, Poland, Hungary, and other countries helped those affected by the \\nwar, welcoming Ukrainian refugees into their homes and organizing the transport of aid packages. Overall, we \\ndonated more than € 4 million as well as medicines such as Euthyrox® and Erbitux®. We delivered innovations \\nto support manufacturers of mRNA vaccines. And we embedded sustainability even more firmly into our \\nenterprise strategy, taking numerous concrete steps, as described in this Annual Report and in our \\nSustainability Report for 2022. \\n\\nAs geopolitical tensions increase in many parts of the world, I believe it has rarely been so important to be a \\nvalue-driven company. Merck will need to continue to adapt to the various challenges and uncertainties \\nworldwide. Yet resilience has always been a competitive advantage of ours, enabling us to anticipate change, \\ncontinuously evolve, and thrive during challenging times. \\n\\nThis tremendous capacity for resilience is reflected by our overall business performance in 2022. Once again, \\nour “Big 3”, namely Process Solutions and Life Science Services, new Healthcare products as well as \\nSemiconductor Solutions, were key in driving growth, combined with the strong performance of established \\nportfolio products. All three of our business sectors made significant contributions to the success of Merck. \\n\\nMerck will need to continue to adapt to the \\nvarious challenges and uncertainties worldwide. \\nYet resilience has always been a competitive \\nadvantage of ours, enabling us to anticipate \\nchange, continuously evolve, and thrive during \\nchallenging times.  \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cTo our Shareholders ___ Letter from Belén Garijo \\n\\n7  \\n\\nAcross our Life Science sector, we collaborate with the global scientific community to drive scientific \\nbreakthroughs by delivering a broad and deep portfolio of more than 300,000 products. \\n\\nTo meet growing demand and seize new emerging opportunities, our Life Science business sector continued to \\nexpand across sites in the United States, Europe and Asia in 2022. For example, in Cork, Ireland, we \\nannounced an investment of around € 440 million to expand our membrane and filtration manufacturing \\ncapabilities. This represents the largest investment in a single site ever for our Life Science business sector.  \\n\\nIn Rockville, Maryland, United States, we are investing more than € 290 million in our biosafety testing \\ncapacity, making this our largest investment in this essential requirement for drug development and \\ncommercialization to date. Further highlights include the significant expansion and regionalization of our single-\\nuse manufacturing capabilities with additional investments of € 130 million in Molsheim, France, and \\n€ 100 million in Wuxi, China.   \\n\\nOrganic expansions like these are part of our ambitious, multi-year program to increase production capacity \\nand our overall Life Science capabilities. They will support growing global demand for lifesaving therapies, \\nincluding vaccines, as well as provide products and services for biopharmaceutical manufacturing. \\n\\nIn Healthcare, patients are at the center of everything we do. With every medical breakthrough, we contribute \\nto creating, improving and prolonging lives.  \\n\\nIn 2022, our oncology drug Tepmetko® was approved in the European Union for the treatment of adult patients \\nwith an aggressive form of non-small cell lung cancer. \\n\\nWe are also pleased with the advances in our development pipeline. This includes, for example, our oral \\ncompound enpatoran, which is in Phase II development for lupus, and xevinapant, which is being investigated \\nin head and neck tumors in two Phase III studies.  \\n\\nBringing to market innovative, specialized medicines that make a meaningful difference to patients globally is \\nimportant to us – and the outlook is promising. That is why in 2022 we announced our ambition to launch one \\nnew Healthcare product or major indication every 1.5 years on average, bolstered by external innovation. We \\nwill build on our expertise in the underlying biology of our focused therapeutic areas of oncology, neurology and \\nimmunology and leverage our technological capabilities, in particular our industry-leading antibody-drug \\nconjugate (ADC) technology. \\n\\nTo accelerate the discovery and availability of future medicines for patients, we laid the cornerstones for our \\nTranslational Science Center as well as the Launch and Technology Center at our global headquarters in \\nDarmstadt, Germany. They are part of a € 1.5 billion investment package announced in March 2022 and are \\nexpected to be fully operational by end of 2025. \\n\\nIn Electronics, we are at the heart of the industry enabling the digital transformation. As almost every \\nelectronic device uses one of our products, we are advancing virtually every aspect of digital living. Our \\nmaterials and solutions are changing the way information is generated, accessed, stored, processed, and \\ndisplayed. \\n\\nIn 2022, we continued to serve as a strong and reliable partner to our global base of customers. This applies \\nespecially to the chip industry, where over the past years demand for semiconductors has risen sharply thanks \\nto the rapid adoption of modern digital technologies. \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cTo our Shareholders ___ Letter from Belén Garijo \\n\\n8  \\n\\nWith the industry growth there is also an increasing need to innovate sustainable materials. One example is the \\njoint development of gas solutions with a low global warming potential (GWP) used in the production of \\nsemiconductors together with Micron Technology, Inc., an industry leader in innovative memory and storage \\nsolutions. Micron is now testing an alternative low-GWP Etch gas from Merck’s research and development unit \\nto validate its process performance to replace a traditional, high-GWP material. \\n\\nThanks to the solid performance of our three business sectors in all our geographic regions in 2022, Group net \\nsales totaled € 22.2 billion – an organic increase of 6.4% over the previous year. At € 6.8 billion, Group EBITDA \\npre, our key financial indicator used to steer our operating business, also saw significant organic growth of \\n6.1%. We now have excellent financial flexibility, which I believe is key to realizing our very ambitious \\ninvestment and growth plans. And once again you as a shareholder also benefit. We will propose to the Annual \\nGeneral Meeting a dividend of € 2.20 for 2022. \\n\\nThese successes would not have been possible without the unwavering commitment of our more than 64,000 \\ncolleagues worldwide. On behalf of the Executive Board, I want to thank them for their dedication in these \\nchallenging times. \\n\\nThanks to our resilient business model, we are well-positioned to further consolidate our position and move \\nforward as one of the world’s leading science and technology companies. \\n\\nOur mid-term outlook remains robust and we are committed to our target of € 25 billion in sales by 2025. Our \\n“Big 3” businesses will continue to grow strongly and generate the majority of our sales in 2025. Additionally, \\nwe will clearly invest for growth by following our strategic roadmap. \\n\\nIn Life Science, we are focusing on driving growth in important areas such as bioprocessing through innovation \\nand significant capacity expansions. We will focus on building scale across our products and services for novel \\nmodalities to further consolidate our position in this attractive, growing market. In addition, we are digitalizing \\nour offerings to meet evolving customer needs and we will continue to explore inorganic growth opportunities \\nacross our portfolios. \\n\\nIn Healthcare, securing the next wave of growth from our pipeline by advancing the evobrutinib and xevinapant \\nprograms will remain vital for us. At the same time, in order to continue to drive profitable growth, we will \\nfocus on delivering on the growth prospects of our wave 1 launches of Mavenclad®, Bavencio® and Tepmetko®, \\nand maximizing the value of our strong established portfolio. \\n\\nAs we look to the future of Electronics, we are committed to harnessing unprecedented opportunities within our \\nmarkets. To ensure that we are prepared adequately, we intend to heavily invest in our capabilities and drive \\ninnovation leadership in our businesses, especially in Semiconductor Solutions. As part of this strategy, we are \\nalso building on our expertise in data analytics to bolster our core businesses and establish new business \\nmodels. \\n\\nOur goals are ambitious, and that must be our aspiration. The external market environment is not getting any \\neasier – on the contrary. Demanding times lie ahead of us – with persistent increases in the costs of raw \\nmaterials, energy and logistics. \\n\\nDespite a macro environment of major uncertainty, we remain confident about our prospects thanks to our \\n“Mobilize for Growth” strategy and the resilience we have built over our extraordinary 355-year history. Our \\nfinancial position is favorable, with a strong balance sheet, sufficient cash reserves and moderate fixed-cost \\nexposure. Our operating model is based on a high degree of diversification in the three business sectors and \\nlow cyclicality. We have robust supply chains due to increasing localization. Thanks to our broad geographic \\nfootprint, we are not dependent on one single region. \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cTo our Shareholders ___ Letter from Belén Garijo \\n\\n9  \\n\\nAt the same time, we have placed a strong focus on sustainability as an integral part of our strategy, linked \\nwith clear sustainability goals. In 2022, the independent Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) confirmed that \\nour emissions targets for 2030 correspond to the current status of climate science. Consequently, Merck is \\nhelping to limit global warming to 1.5 °C, thus meeting the requirements of the Paris Agreement. \\n\\nAs you continue to read this Annual Report, I hope it becomes even more clear how we at Merck are fully \\ncommitted to creating attractive and sustainable value for our owners, shareholders, customers, employees, \\nand society at large. \\n\\nI am honored by your trust as shareholders of Merck and look forward to your continued support in these \\nendeavors. \\n\\nSincerely,  \\n\\nBelén Garijo \\nChair of the Executive Board and CEO\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cTo our Shareholders ___ The Executive Board \\n\\n10  \\n\\nThe Executive Board \\n\\nMarcus Kuhnert \\nMember of the \\nExecutive Board \\n\\nKai Beckmann \\nMember of the \\nExecutive Board \\n\\nChief Financial \\nOfficer \\n\\nCEO Electronics \\n\\nBelén Garijo \\nChair of the \\nExecutive Board  \\nand \\nCEO \\n\\nPeter Guenter \\nMember of the \\nExecutive Board \\n\\nMatthias Heinzel \\nMember of the \\nExecutive Board \\n\\nCEO Healthcare \\n\\nCEO Life Science \\n\\nShort biographies \\n\\nMore information can be found on our website.\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cTo our Shareholders ___ Merck Shares \\n\\n11  \\n\\nMerck Shares \\n\\nAt a glance \\n\\nThe stock markets were again subject to considerable uncertainty in 2022. Geopolitical turmoil, inflation, and \\nthe energy cost crisis were the most important factors depending on the respective industry. Accordingly, \\nMerck’s share price also fluctuated substantially over the course of 2022. \\n\\nThe first months of the year were dominated by the uncertainty caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which \\nadversely affected investor expectations in the Electronics business sector in particular. The Life Science \\nbusiness sector was also impacted by the uncertainty resulting from the contraction in business with products \\nfor combating the Covid-19 pandemic. Taken together, these developments meant that Merck’s share price \\nunderperformed relative to the DAX® and the sector indices. However, most of this shortfall was recovered by \\nthe middle of the year thanks to the Group’s relatively low energy intensity and the pronounced resilience of its \\nbusiness model. \\n\\nThe four sets of good quarterly figures we reported in 2022 in spite of the challenging market environment only \\nserved to offset the uncertainty on the market to a limited extent. Merck’s share price declined by around 20% \\nacross the year as a whole. This meant it underperformed compared with the DAX®, which fell by around 12% \\non a full-year basis. The index for the pharmaceutical industry considerably outperformed Merck’s shares, rising \\nby almost 2%. The index for the chemicals industry also performed slightly better than Merck’s shares with a \\nfall of around 17%. However, the indices for the semiconductor industry (-36%) and the life science industry  \\n(-23%) performed worse than Merck’s shares. Merck’s shares closed at € 180.90 on December 30, 2022 \\n(2021: € 227.00). \\n\\nAt approximately 321,000 shares per day, the average daily trading volume of Merck shares in 2022 was down \\naround 7% on the prior-year figure of around 346,000. This meant Merck’s shares followed the general trend of \\nlower turnover on Germany’s securities trading platforms in 2022 compared with the previous year. The \\nuncertainty on the financial markets may have generally made investors more reluctant to trade in shares. \\n\\nOur shareholder structure remained largely stable in 2022 compared with the previous year: Europe continues \\nto account for the largest proportion of the free float at around half, followed by the United States with around \\n29%. Compared with 2021, there was a slight shift away from growth investors in favor of value investors and \\nGARP (growth at a reasonable price) investors, who combine growth and value investing attributes. The four \\nbiggest investors, who each exceed the threshold of 3%, currently hold around 19% of the free float \\ncumulatively. \\n\\nIn 2022, the Merck Executive Board and the Investor Relations team held around 1,000 discussions with \\ninvestors on topics such as strategy, the business model, business performance, corporate governance, and \\nsustainability at Merck during investor conferences, roadshows, and conference calls. \\n\\n \\n\\x0cTo our Shareholders ___ Merck Shares \\n\\n12  \\n\\nMerck Shares \\n\\nShare price development from January 1, 2022, to December 31, 2022, in % \\n\\nMerck Shares \\nKey share price data1 \\n\\nDividend2 \\n\\nShare price high \\n\\nShare price low \\n\\nYear-end share price \\n\\nDaily average number of Merck shares traded3 \\n\\nMarket capitalization4 (at year-end) \\n\\nMarket value of authorized shares5 (at year-end) \\n\\n € \\n\\n € \\n\\n € \\n\\n € \\n\\n Number \\n\\n € million \\n\\n € million \\n\\n2022   \\n\\n2.20   \\n\\n222.90   \\n\\n156.10   \\n\\n180.90   \\n\\n2021 \\n\\n1.85 \\n\\n229.40 \\n\\n130.10 \\n\\n227.00 \\n\\n321,232   \\n\\n346,230 \\n\\n78,651   \\n\\n23,380   \\n\\n98,695 \\n\\n29,338 \\n\\n1 Share price-relevant figures relate to the closing price in Xetra ® trading on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. \\n\\n2 2022 dividend subject to approval by the Annual General Meeting. \\n\\n3 Based on the floor trading systems of all German exchanges and the regulated market on Xetra ®. \\n\\n4 Based on the theoretical number of shares (434.8 million). \\n\\n5 Based on the number of shares in free float (129.2 million).

This collaboration will help accelerate the drug \\nsubmission and approval process for the biopharmaceutical industry in China using our first-to-market Blazar® \\nRodent Panel for virus testing, reducing animal testing through molecular-based technology and biosafety \\nturnaround time by up to 80%. \\n\\nScience and Lab Solutions* \\n\\nIn February, we collaborated with Waters Corporation to build and expand an Extractables and Leachables \\n(E&L) Reference Library to include ion mobility measurements. The library will enable analytical labs to identify \\npotential extractables and leachable compounds in their samples by using Waters’ ion mobility-enabled liquid \\nchromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) instruments and then confirm the identity and quantity using our \\nSupelco® reference materials. The library is cross-linked to our Life Science business sector’s online product \\ncatalog to provide users access to reference materials to confirm their results. \\n\\nWe also expanded our ZooMAb® recombinant monoclonal antibodies product portfolio with 72 new products and \\nadded 23 new products to the ColorWheel® flow cytometry antibodies and dyes portfolio. ZooMAb is the first-\\never antibody to receive the ACT label designation and received the lowest environmental impact factor (EIF) \\nscores in the chemicals and reagents category.  \\n\\nIn the Life Science business sector, our dedication to the customer experience extends from the lab to our \\nprimary e-commerce platform, sigmaaldrich.com, which connects tens of millions of visitors in nearly every \\ncountry around the world with the products, services, and technical expertise needed to advance their \\ndiscovery, research, and development further and faster. We have accelerated our rate of eCommerce \\ninnovation by improving our site speed, expanding our product document library, and making it easier for \\ncustomers to find what they need with new, differentiating user experiences.  \\n\\nInvestments to expand capabilities and production* \\n\\nIn April, we announced a € 100 million investment for our first Asia-Pacific Mobius® Single-Use Manufacturing \\nCenter in Wuxi, China. This investment supports the fast-growing biotech innovation sector in China and is \\nrealized in close collaboration with the Administrative Management Committee of the Wuxi National High-Tech \\nIndustrial Development Zone to jointly cultivate and enhance the life science ecosystem in the Wuxi area and \\nthroughout China.  \\n\\nIn May, we announced an investment of approximately € 440 million to increase membrane manufacturing \\ncapacity in Carrigtwohill and build a new manufacturing facility at Blarney Business Park, both in Cork, Ireland. \\nThe investment, the largest in a single site ever for the Life Science business sector, will create more than 370 \\npermanent jobs by the end of 2027. \\n\\nIn July, we broke ground at our site in Sheboygan, Wisconsin, USA, for our first lateral flow membrane \\nproduction facility in the United States. Lateral flow membranes are vital in rapid diagnostic test kits for various \\napplications, ranging from Covid-19 to other infectious diseases. The new facility is supported by a \\n€ 121 million contract award from the U.S. Department of Defense on behalf of the U.S. Department of Health \\nand Human Services. The Sheboygan location further supports our competitive advantage by providing \\nimproved supply security and reduced lead times for global customers.  \\n\\nIn September, we announced an investment of more than € 130 million to strengthen our manufacturing \\ncapabilities for single-use assemblies, a key technology for the production of Covid-19 vaccines and other \\nlifesaving therapies, in Molsheim, France. The investment is the largest ever in the 50-year history of the site \\nand will create more than 800 jobs by the end of 2028. \\n\\n* The contents of this chapter or section are voluntary and therefore not audited. However, our auditor has read the text critically. \\n\\n \\n\\x0cCombined Management Report ___ Fundamental Information about the Group ___ Merck \\n\\n19 \\n\\nAlso in September, we opened a new viral clearance (VC) laboratory as part of the first building phase of our \\nnew € 29 million Shanghai-based China Biologics Testing Center. The 5,000 square meter center, the first of its \\nkind for our company in China, is designed to meet the double-digit demand for VC testing services in the \\ncountry. Customers will now be able to locally conduct viral clearance studies from pre-clinical development to \\ncommercialization, a critical step in drug development required by regulatory agencies to complete clinical trials \\nnecessary to move to commercial manufacturing. The second phase of the center’s facilities will open in late \\n2023 and offer cell line characterization and lot release testing services.  \\n\\nIn November, we announced a € 290 million investment in a new facility to support the increasing demand for \\nbiosafety testing services at our Rockville, Maryland, USA, site. The new 23,000 square meter facility will \\nconsolidate the multi-building campus into one facility that will open in 2024 to significantly increase our \\nbiosafety testing capacity, creating over 500 new jobs in the region. This is the largest testing investment in \\ncompany history. \\n\\nFrom pandemic to endemic* \\n\\nAs the Covid-19 pandemic devolves into an endemic, we continue providing customers with products and \\nsolutions that empower scientists to study long-term effects, detect and characterize viruses, and develop and \\nmanufacture vaccines and therapies. We have supported more than 35 testing solutions across RT-PCR, \\nantigen, and antibody diagnostics for both high-throughput centralized and distributed point-of-care settings; \\nmore than 80 different vaccine programs, consisting of several platforms that include DNA, Inactivated, Live \\nAttenuated Virus, Viral Vector, Protein Subunit and mRNA; and more than 50 monoclonal antibodies, plasma-\\nderived products, and antiviral treatments.  \\n\\nHealthcare \\n\\nHealthcare discovers, develops, manufactures, and markets innovative pharmaceutical and biological \\nprescription drugs to treat cancer, multiple sclerosis (MS), infertility, growth disorders, and certain \\ncardiovascular and metabolic diseases. Healthcare operates across four therapeutic areas with a clear ambition \\nto become a global specialty innovator: Neurology and Immunology, Oncology, Fertility, and Cardiology \\nMetabolism & Endocrinology. Our R&D pipeline positions us with a clear focus on strengthening our leadership \\npositions in oncology, neurology, and immunology. \\n\\nSince the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, we have been continuously making every effort to proactively handle \\nthe situation and minimize the impact of the pandemic and also of any challenges from the external context on \\nthe supply of our medicines locally and globally. To this end, we are using three main levers: the thorough \\nimplementation and further development of our business continuity plans across our network, the active \\nmanagement of our stocks, and the assessment of alternative transportation routes to reach our customers and \\npatients. \\n\\nIn 2022, Healthcare generated 35% of Group sales and 33% of EBITDA pre (excluding Corporate and Other). \\nEurope and North America generated 54% of Healthcare’s net sales in 2022. In recent years, we have steadily \\nexpanded our presence in growth markets. In 2022, Asia-Pacific and Latin America accounted for 39% of sales. \\n\\nOncology*\\n\\nErbitux® (cetuximab) is the best-selling drug in terms of revenue in the portfolio of our Biopharma business, is \\nour flagship product in oncology, reaching € 1 billion in sales in 2022. Treating more than 1 million patients \\nsince authorization, the product is a standard of care for patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-\\nexpressing, RAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), as well as both recurrent and/or metastatic \\nand locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). We continue to advance our \\n\\n* The contents of this chapter or section are voluntary and therefore not audited. However, our auditor has read the text critically. \\n\\n \\n\\x0cCombined Management Report ___ Fundamental Information about the Group ___ Merck \\n\\n20 \\n\\nbroad lifecycle management strategy, as well, with more than 200 active clinical trials involving Erbitux® \\nincluding 17 Phase III studies, some of which have registrational purpose. \\n\\nTogether with Pfizer Inc., we have made significant progress in transforming the standard of care globally for \\npatients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (UC) as we continue to secure additional \\nregulatory approvals and reimbursement decisions for our anti-PD-L1 antibody Bavencio® (avelumab) (for \\nfurther details see “Research and Development”). As a key growth driver of our Biopharma business, \\nBavencio® is now approved as a first-line maintenance treatment for advanced UC in 63 countries and has \\nbecome a standard of care in the treatment of this disease, based on the results of the JAVELIN Bladder \\n100 trial, the only Phase III study of an immunotherapy to demonstrate a significant overall survival benefit in \\nthe first-line setting. In combination with Inlyta, Bavencio® is also approved in the first-line treatment of \\nadvanced renal cell carcinoma, and it is considered a standard of care as monotherapy in metastatic Merkel cell \\ncarcinoma, a rare form of skin cancer. \\n\\nWe have also continued to expand the availability of Tepmetko® (tepotinib), our oral MET inhibitor designed to \\ninhibit the oncogenic MET receptor signaling caused by MET (gene) alterations, with additional regulatory \\napprovals. In February 2022, the European Commission approved Tepmetko® as monotherapy for the \\ntreatment of adult patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring alterations leading to \\nmesenchymal-epithelial transition factor gene exon METex 14 skipping, who require systemic therapy following \\nprior treatment with immunotherapy and/or platinum-based chemotherapy.  \\n\\nWith this approval, Tepmetko® became the first and only oral MET inhibitor to be approved in the European \\nEconomic Area for treating adult patients with advanced NSCLC harboring alterations leading to METex14 \\nskipping, who require systemic therapy following prior treatment. Tepmetko® is now available in a number of \\ncountries globally. \\n\\nWith xevinapant, our potentially first-in-class IAP (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein) inhibitor, we are building on \\nour long-standing leadership in the treatment of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). Five-\\nyear results from the 96-patient Phase II study presented at the European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO) \\nAnnual Meeting in September 2022 showed that adding xevinapant to chemoradiotherapy (CRT) markedly \\nimproved long-term efficacy outcomes in patients with unresected locally advanced SCCHN. This data reinforces \\nthe transformative potential of xevinapant over standard of care in the curative setting (for further details see \\n“Research and Development”). We have advanced our global Phase III development program this year, with \\nTrilynX and XRay Vision now recruiting patients.  \\n\\nWe made continued progress in our pipeline in 2022, as we advanced the first antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) \\ndeveloped in our labs, the anti-CEACAM5 ADC M9140, into Phase I. \\n\\nBeyond our ADC platform, our broad portfolio of small-molecule DNA Damage Response (DDR) inhibitors \\nrepresents multiple development paths as monotherapy or in combination with other DDR inhibitors, \\nimmunotherapy, chemotherapy, or radiotherapy. \\n\\nIn 2022, we advanced the development of our potentially best-in-class, potent and selective inhibitor of ataxia \\ntelangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR), M1774. Following completion of the monotherapy dose-escalation part \\nof the DDRiver Solid Tumors 301 study, a monotherapy dose for M1774 has been confirmed for further \\nevaluation in Phase Ib (for further details see “Research and Development”). \\n\\nOn June 3, 2022, we announced that, following an interim analysis of the ongoing global Phase II DDRiver SCLC \\n250 trial of berzosertib in combination with topotecan in patients with relapsed, platinum-resistant small cell \\nlung cancer (SCLC), we decided to discontinue the study due to low probability of meeting the pre-defined \\nobjective of this trial (for further details see “Research and Development”).\\n\\n \\n \\n\\x0cCombined Management Report ___ Fundamental Information about the Group ___ Merck \\n\\n21 \\n\\nTo further support our focused research and development efforts in the area of DDR inhibition, in September \\n2022 we entered a collaboration agreement with licensing option with Nerviano Medical Sciences S.r.l. for the \\nnext-generation highly selective and brain-penetrant PARP1 (poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase) inhibitor NMS-293 \\n(for further details see “Research and Development”). The option to license this molecule provides us with the \\noptionality to develop a next-generation PARP inhibitor in combination with our early pipeline of DDR inhibitors \\nand DNA-damaging ADCs.  \\n\\nNeurology & Immunology* \\n\\nWe have a long-standing legacy in neurology and immunology, including more than two decades of experience \\nin multiple sclerosis (MS). We are committed to people living with neuroinflammatory and immune-mediated \\ndiseases by focusing on finding solutions addressing unmet medical needs. Our current MS portfolio includes \\ntwo approved products for the treatment of relapsing MS (RMS) – Rebif® (interferon beta-1a) and Mavenclad® \\n(cladribine tablets). In addition, we are pioneering the therapeutic usage of Bruton’s tyrosine kinase inhibition \\nfor MS through the discovery and development of evobrutinib, which targets both inflammatory activity in the \\ncentral nervous system and immune cells in the periphery to address the underlying causes of ongoing disease \\nprogression. Evobrutinib is an investigational highly-selective, oral, CNS-penetrant BTK inhibitor with the \\npotential to become a best-in-class treatment option for people living with RMS. Evobrutinib is in Phase III \\ndevelopment for RMS. \\n\\nMavenclad® is approved in 88 countries worldwide, including those of the European Union, Switzerland, \\nAustralia, Canada, and the United States, for various forms of highly active RMS.  \\n\\nIt is a short-course oral therapy for the treatment of adults with various forms of highly active RMS. Rebif®, a \\ndisease-modifying drug used to treat RMS, is and remains a well-established therapy. It has been a standard \\ntreatment in RMS for more than 20 years and has more than 1.8 million patient-years of therapy since \\napproval. \\n\\nIn addition to our commitment to MS, we also have a pipeline focusing on discovering new therapies that have \\npotential in other neuroinflammatory and immune-mediated diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus \\n(SLE) and cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE).  \\n\\nEnpatoran, a highly specific potential first-in-class immune modulator blocking the activation of Toll-like \\nreceptor (TLR)7 and TLR8, is being developed as a potential new oral therapy for systemic lupus erythematosus \\n(SLE) and cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE). It aims to overcome limitations of available lupus therapies by \\nproviding selective inhibition of lupus-relevant disease drivers, which may increase efficacy while preserving \\nimmunity against infections. In March 2022, we announced that our first randomized patient was enrolled in our \\nPhase II (WILLOW) study. We remain on track with recruitment of additional patients. \\n\\nIn January 2022, we entered into an out-licensing agreement for sprifermin with TrialSpark/High Line Bio, New \\nYork, USA. Sprifermin, a recombinant form of human fibroblast growth factor 18, is currently being investigated \\nin patients with osteoarthritis. \\n\\nFertility* \\n\\nAs the global market leader in fertility drugs and treatments, our fertility franchise is an important contributor \\nto our Healthcare business. According to updated data, more than five million babies have been born worldwide \\nwith the help of GONAL-f®, a leading therapeutic within our fertility portfolio.  \\n\\nInfertility continues to represent an increasing challenge globally due to demographic changes and ongoing \\nlifestyle adjustments like delayed childbearing. In 2022, our fertility business grew and recorded significant \\nprogress across our fertility portfolio from launches to congress presentations and data studies.  \\n\\n* The contents of this chapter or section are voluntary and therefore not audited. However, our auditor has read the text critically. \\n\\n \\n\\x0cCombined Management Report ___ Fundamental Information about the Group ___ Merck \\n\\n22 \\n\\nOur GONAL-f® 150 IU pen contains the active substance follitropin alfa, a copy of the natural hormone FSH. \\nTreatment with GONAL-f® results in more follicles, oocytes, and embryos than urinary gonadotropins, \\nincreasing the chance of pregnancy and live birth. In 2022, GONAL-f® 150 IU pen was further launched in \\nseveral European and APAC (Asia Pacific) countries, including France, the Baltic countries, Indonesia, Malaysia, \\nand Singapore. Further launches are expected in Europe, APAC, and MEAR (Middle East, Africa, Turkey, Russia, \\nand the Commonwealth of Independent States) regions in 2023, and in Japan in 2024.  \\n\\nOur Pergoveris® pen is the first product with a combination of recombinant human follicle-stimulating hormone \\n(r-hFSH) and recombinant human luteinizing hormone (r-hLH) in a ready-to-use liquid version, eliminating the \\nneed for mixing. This makes it a suitable treatment option for women with severe FSH and LH deficiency. In \\n2022, the Pergoveris® pen was successfully launched in Saudi Arabia and Argentina, among others. It is now \\navailable in 51 countries. Launches around the globe will continue in order to provide patients with access to \\nthis therapeutic. \\n\\nCardiology Metabolism & Endocrinology* \\n\\nEvery day, more than 90 million patients around the world use our trusted Cardiology Metabolism & \\nEndocrinology (CM&E) medications. Concor®, Euthyrox®, Glucophage®, and Saizen® are CM&E brands and \\ncontribute to making CM&E the largest business franchise of the Healthcare business sector in terms of sales, \\nwith strong growth in all major therapeutic areas of focus, contributing significantly to our overall profitability. \\n\\nConcor®/Concor Cor®, containing bisoprolol, is a beta-blocker for treating hypertension and cardiovascular \\ndiseases such as coronary heart diseases and chronic heart failure. In addition to Concor®/Concor Cor®, the \\nConcor® family offers fixed-dose combinations such as Concor Plus®/Lodoz® (bisoprolol with \\nhydrochlorothiazide). \\n\\nEuthyrox®, with the active ingredient levothyroxine, is the worldwide market leader for the treatment of \\nhypothyroidism, a disease with high prevalence but still low diagnosis rates in most emerging markets.  \\n\\nGlucophage®, containing the active ingredient metformin, is the drug of choice for first-line treatment of type 2 \\ndiabetes available in more than 100 countries. During 2021, multiple health authorities worldwide continued to \\napprove Glucophage® in prediabetes when intensive lifestyle changes have failed. This indication for \\nGlucophage® is now registered in 89 countries. Overall, considering the high prevalence of prediabetes and \\ndiabetes, we continue seeing great potential for Glucophage®. \\n\\nSaizen®, with its active ingredient somatropin, is our main endocrinology product and is indicated for the \\ntreatment of growth hormone deficiency in children and adults. Saizen® can be delivered with the Easypod® \\nelectromechanical injection device, the only growth hormone injection device able to wirelessly transfer data \\nsuch as injection times, dates, and doses to the web-based software system Easypod® Connect, making it \\neasier for healthcare practitioners and patients to manage adherence and helping to reach their treatment \\ngoals. Aluetta® (the new Saizen® pen) is now available in 28 countries with the objective of expanding the \\nreach of Saizen®, offering additional options for healthcare practitioners and patients and expanding our devices \\nportfolio. \\n\\nIn endocrinology, we differentiate ourselves from competitors through leadership in the eHealth space, both by \\nbuilding evidence and by leveraging the meaningful use of technology to provide new solutions for patient \\nengagement, partnership with healthcare practitioners and better payer value proposition.  \\n\\n* The contents of this chapter or section are voluntary and therefore not audited.

We believe that scientific exploration and responsible \\nentrepreneurship are key to technological advances that benefit us all. Our values – courage, achievement, \\nresponsibility, respect, integrity, and transparency – guide us in every step we take and in every decision we \\nmake. As a company, we have a strong foundation. These fundamentals have been defined by the Merck \\nfamily. We always take them into consideration when discussing and deciding on our Enterprise strategy. \\n\\n•  We follow a risk diversification strategy with three distinct business sectors, and we avoid overexposure to \\nany single customer, industry, or geography. We ensure resilience against business disruption and deep \\ncrises. \\n\\n•  With our science and technology focus, we want to be leaders in our fields of expertise and markets, always \\npushing the boundaries to find new solutions and drive innovation. We aim to create value for our business \\nand for society. \\n\\n•  We continue to operate under our current ownership with the Merck family as the majority owner. \\n\\n•  We deliver sustainable value, and we want to maintain an attractive financial profile (for example, a strong \\ncredit rating) while assessing and considering the ESG (environmental, social, governance) impact of our \\ngrowth ambition. \\n\\n•  Mergers and acquisitions (M&A) are an important driver of our long-term value creation strategy with a \\n\\nfocus on innovation-driven technology. \\n\\nEnterprise strategy \\n\\nOur ambition \\n\\nOur ambition is to become the global 21st century science and technology pioneer. To achieve this, we will \\ncontinue to focus on our “Big 3” businesses: Process Solutions and Life Science Services, new Healthcare \\nproducts, and Semiconductor Solutions. Until 2025, these businesses are expected to generate approximately \\n80% of the targeted sales growth, and more than 50% of total sales by 2025. \\n\\nDespite the current turbulent environment, which is a stress test for our business model and strategy, we \\nremain fully on track to reach our mid-term growth target of € 25 billion in sales by 2025. We confirm our mid-\\nterm forecast for the business sectors: In the Life Science business sector, organic sales will grow 7% to 10% \\nper year on average, driven by the strong development of the core business. Consequently, the forecast would \\nbe achieved even amid a complete absence of pandemic-related demand. The Healthcare business sector will \\nshow average annual organic sales growth in the mid-single-digit percentage range. In addition to positive \\ncontributions of the established portfolio products, growth is expected to come from new medicines and \\npotential market launches including evobrutinib (multiple sclerosis) and xevinapant (head and neck cancer). In \\nthe Electronics business sector, our expected mid-term organic sales growth will amount to 3% to 6% per year \\non average driven by the strong above market performance of Semiconductor Solutions and our comprehensive \\nportfolio in this field. \\n\\nOur highly resilient business sectors are the foundation for our bold plans to accelerate efficient growth and \\nseize organic and inorganic opportunities.\\n\\nWe attribute our high capacity for resilience to several factors, notably: \\n\\n* The contents of this chapter or section are voluntary and therefore not audited. However, our auditor has read the text critically. \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cCombined Management Report ___ Fundamental Information about the Group ___ Strategy \\n\\n26 \\n\\n•  Good financial position: strong balance sheet, sufficient cash reserves and moderate fixed cost exposure  \\n\\n•  High degree of diversification in the three business sectors amid low cyclicality  \\n\\n•  Robust supply networks due to increasing localization  \\n\\n•  Lower dependency on single regions thanks to diversified footprint  \\n\\n•  Strong focus on sustainability as an integral part of the company strategy, linked with clear sustainability \\n\\ngoals.  \\n\\nUp until 2025, we expect to grow sales organically by at least 6% on average per year, equating to an increase \\nof more than € 1 billion annually. To this end, we are making targeted investments worldwide to expand our \\nregional capacities, such as the expansions of our Life Science manufacturing sites in Rockville, USA, in \\nMolsheim, France and in Wuxi, China, as well as the construction of our Translational Science Center and \\nLaunch & Technology Center for our Healthcare business sector in Darmstadt, Germany. In Electronics – as part \\nof our Level Up program – we are investing in our highly attractive growth markets such as semiconductors by \\nexpanding our global production and innovation footprint in close proximity to our customers. \\n\\nIn addition to our organic growth objectives, we plan further in-licensing and bolt-on acquisitions. For example, \\nwe announced the closing of the transaction to acquire the chemicals business of Mecaro, a Korean supplier to \\nthe semiconductor industry. Another recent example is the collaboration agreement including licensing option \\nwith Nerviano Medical Sciences S.r.L. (NMS) for the development of a novel oncology drug. In addition, as of \\n2023, we will once again consider potential larger-scale acquisitions as an option. Our inorganic growth \\ninitiatives will fit our strategic direction, with high priority being given to the Big 3 businesses.  \\n\\nLooking forward, we further identify transformative technologies to be pivotal enablers for our growth and \\ninnovation ambition. Therefore, we will look into novel technologies beyond our core products and markets \\nwhile keeping in strategic proximity to our business sectors to leverage our existing assets and capabilities.  \\n\\nOur Group Science & Technology Office is leading the implementation of our combined strategy for innovation \\nand “Data & Digital,” fostering innovation in as well as across our business sectors through seeding and \\nintegrating transformative technology trends while harnessing the power of cutting-edge data and digital \\ncapacities. To enable our businesses and accelerate innovation through data we are deploying a company-wide \\nharmonized Data and Analytics Operating Model and Ecosystem. This allows us to derive actionable insights \\nfrom data, support informed decision-making, and scale related activities across the company to solve business \\nchallenges with machine learning and artificial intelligence. Data culture is foundational for our digital \\ntransformation. Through dedicated data upskilling activities, we are strengthening the ability of our workforce \\nto identify, understand, create, model, analyze, interpret, communicate, and argue with data. \\n\\nBusiness strategies \\n\\nLife Science \\n\\nOur Life Science business sector is a global leader in the ~€ 200 billion ex Covid life sciences industry. We \\ncontinue to consistently deliver profitable growth in this market that is growing ~5 to 7% CAGR. While our \\nstrategy has not changed – strengthen our core business and expand in high-growth segments – our priorities \\nnow reflect changes in the external environment, with an even sharper focus on our strategy, further enabled \\nby digitalization, innovation, and enhanced capabilities. In February 2022, we announced a new organizational \\nstructure focusing on the customer and portfolio, across three distinct business units: Process Solutions \\ndedicated to consumables and instruments, Life Science Services delivering pharmaceutical testing, \\nmanufacturing, and development services, and Science and Lab Solutions unifying offerings for the research \\nand applied markets.  \\n\\n \\n \\n\\x0cCombined Management Report ___ Fundamental Information about the Group ___ Strategy \\n\\n27 \\n\\nProcess Solutions is focused on innovation in process development, building a robust supply network, and \\nexpanding capacity to capture accelerating market growth. Customers and governments increasingly view \\nbioprocess consumables as a strategic resource and prefer regional suppliers. Our plan calls for a shift from \\nmanufacturing centers of excellence to increasingly in-region, for-region production. We will continue to invest \\nheavily in new capacity for key portfolios including single-use, filtration and cell culture media. This will improve \\ncustomer service levels and increase our resilience. In addition, innovation remains critical. Our deep expertise \\nin monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and proteins provides a launchpad to offer fit-for-purpose products for the \\nefficient manufacturing of novel modalities, such as viral vectors, and mRNA and cell therapies, which are all \\ngrowing rapidly. \\n\\nScience and Lab Solutions unites our strong positions across diverse lab and testing segments, including \\nacademia, pharmaceutical R&D and diagnostics, among others. This exposure provides exceptional resilience \\nand predictable, profitable growth. Our strategic focus here is to ensure our long-term competitiveness as \\ncustomer needs evolve. We are poised to continue our legacy of innovation for the lab, adding digital features \\nand greener alternatives to our expansive product portfolio, and enhancing omnichannel engagement, by \\nproviding a seamless customer experience through all purchasing channels, from our sales representatives to \\nour leading eCommerce platform. \\n\\nWe have already unified our service offerings under the Life Science Services business to build our presence in \\nthe attractive and growing contract testing, development, and manufacturing organization (CTDMO) segment. \\nHere we have a strong foundation, with more than 25 years of CDMO expertise, a global footprint, and \\ncapabilities across the value chain. Our vision is to move from an emerging, multi-modality CDMO and CTO to a \\nfull-service and focused, multi-modality CTDMO. To enable this in the near term, we will focus on streamlined \\nsales and a robust customer pipeline, ultimately increasing global scale and reach. \\n\\nAcross Life Science, we are also raising our ambition in the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region. As noted, our plans \\ninclude establishing additional in-region, for-region infrastructure. At the same time, we will enhance our \\nsupport level across the APAC region, sharing our technological expertise with customers to become a true \\npartner in this fast-growing market. \\n\\nOur Life Science business sector is poised to deliver sustained growth in a dynamic market through supply \\nregionalization, a differentiated customer experience, and accelerated innovation – all aimed at shaping the \\nfuture and fulfilling our purpose to impact life and health with science. \\n\\nHealthcare \\n\\nGlobal megatrends such as growing and aging populations as well as better access to healthcare continue to \\ndrive the need for our products. At the same time, the Covid-19 pandemic has accelerated many anticipated \\nindustry trends within the healthcare sector such as changes in market dynamics, ongoing healthcare reform, \\nand increased digitalization. In recent months, the macroeconomic and geopolitical external environment has \\nbecome more volatile, considering, for example, rising inflation or the war in Ukraine. To meet these demands \\nand respond appropriately to the dynamics of our markets, we have significantly transformed our Healthcare \\nbusiness sector in recent years with the objective of delivering focused leadership and sustaining above-market \\ngrowth through a diversified portfolio that is resilient to long-term volatility. \\n\\nFollowing our successes over the past years, we continue to drive pipeline projects with the aim of bringing \\ngroundbreaking medicines to patients, maximizing our existing portfolio, and continuing our expansion in \\ngrowth markets. We are resolute in our ambition to become a global specialty innovator, with a high-growth \\nfuture in Oncology, Neurology and Immunology, and Fertility – areas where significant unmet medical needs \\nexist and where we can bring meaningful value to patients. We build this ambition on top of a strong foundation \\nand will continue to grow Cardiovascular, Metabolism & Endocrinology sustainably and profitably. We pursue \\nthis ambition with a focused leadership approach, concentrating investments on decorrelated opportunities in \\nour pipeline and across therapeutic areas, regions, and payer types.  \\n\\n \\n \\n\\x0cCombined Management Report ___ Fundamental Information about the Group ___ Strategy \\n\\n28 \\n\\nThe first pillar of our strategy is to reinforce our global footprint, bringing the innovation of our pipeline to \\npatients and growing our presence – in the United States and in China, for example. The emerging markets and \\nChina are expected to be the largest growth drivers for many of our established products in the future. \\nManaging the balance between delivering innovative new medicines with first-in-class and/or best-in class \\npotential while leveraging our strengths in other markets and ensuring the profitable growth of the existing \\nbusiness will be one of the strategic imperatives. Numerous examples in our existing business offer significant \\nopportunities to bring value to patients, and considering their growth potential, maximizing their business \\npotential will remain important.  \\n\\nThe second pillar of our strategy is the focus on specialty medicine franchises. Here, we expect the oncology, \\nneurology, immunology, and fertility markets to remain highly attractive in terms of size, growth prospects, and \\nprofitability. Within each specialty franchise, our approach is to develop deep internal expertise and insight, from \\ninternal research to commercialization, augmented by external talent sourcing and strategic partnering. In order \\nto optimize the value and focus of our pipeline, we continuously monitor and assess the potential of our pipeline \\ncandidates, based on clinical data, strategic fit and financial criteria, to determine the best way forward.  \\n\\nThe third strategic pillar is innovation: We aim to develop potential first-in-class, and best-in-class therapies \\nand to build a portfolio in each of our franchises. We have streamlined our pipeline and expanded our \\ninnovation capabilities with strong investigational drug candidates and technologies. In order to maximize the \\noutput of our R&D investments and increase our chances of success in discovering and developing new \\ntherapies, we focus our expertise on specific franchises and are exploiting synergies in disease mechanisms and \\nbiological pathways. We are investing in digital technologies and novel modalities such as antibody drug \\nconjugates to drive pipeline growth. \\n\\nElectronics \\n\\nWithin the last years, the Electronics business sector has transformed into an innovation leader within the \\nelectronics industry targeting the most critical materials segments of the semiconductor wafer processing as well \\nas OLED and LC display panels. Our diversified portfolio delivers profitable growth and stable attractive cash flows. \\nWe partner with key thought leaders around the world to enable the next generation of electronic devices. \\n\\nThe acceleration of digitization, and its visualization, is fueled by an exponential growth of data and a lasting \\nneed for electronics, especially semiconductor chips across all industrial sectors. Highly impactful technology \\ntrends like artificial intelligence (AI), 5G networks, big data, and Internet of Things (IoT) require more powerful \\nchips and advanced OLED display platforms. In the mid and long term, this growth is expected to continue \\nthrough the next decade, as semiconductors have become a critical component in many industries. \\nUnprecedented investments, in the hundreds of billions of euros, are being announced for new chip \\nmanufacturing capacity across the world. To produce ever more powerful and energy-efficient chips, innovation \\nin novel materials is essential. \\n\\nTo benefit from the strong electronics industry growth, our plan is to expand our capacities and our capabilities. \\nWe have announced investments of significantly more than € 3 billion into innovation and capacities by 2025 \\naligned to the businesses and regions we serve. These investments are an essential part of our sector’s Level \\nUp growth program, which kicked off at the end of 2021.  \\n\\nWe are progressing well in our Level Up program, which focuses on four, mutually reinforcing key priorities: \\nScale, Technology, Portfolio and Capabilities. With Scale and Technology, we support the ongoing capacity \\nexpansion that is happening globally in our focus industries, investing in our footprint in close proximity to our \\ncustomers while boosting R&D and innovation. Under the priority area Portfolio, Electronics seeks to exploit \\nattractive, external growth opportunities via acquisitions. Furthermore, Level Up is accelerating important \\ninternal initiatives under the Capabilities priority. Among other things, it is further leveraging data analytics \\ncapabilities and investing even further into the safety realm.  \\n\\nAfter substantial investments in expanding our production capacities in Surface Solutions, we remain confident \\nto successfully implement its strategic transformation. \\n\\n \\n \\n\\x0cCombined Management Report ___ Fundamental Information about the Group ___ Strategy \\n\\n29 \\n\\nSustainability strategy \\n\\nLeveraging science and technology \\n\\nFor us, sustainable entrepreneurship and profitable growth go hand in hand. Only by creating value for society \\ncan we remain competitive and achieve human progress through our innovations and high-quality products. \\nResponsible action is an integral part of our company culture. This also includes respecting the interests of our \\nemployees, customers, investors, and society. Safety and ethics matter just as much to us as business success. \\nWe mitigate ethical, economic, environmental, and social risks as far as possible. From the early stages of \\ndevelopment through to disposal, we keep an eye on the entire life cycle of a product. We apply strict \\nsustainability standards to our procurement activities. During product manufacture, we strive to keep the \\nenvironmental impact as low as possible, which is why safe production techniques, high environmental \\nstandards and strict quality management are of course so important to us. And with our sustainable products, \\nwe also help the companies that we supply to achieve their sustainability goals.     \\n\\nSustainability is an essential element of our enterprise strategy. We have set ourselves three strategic \\nsustainability goals: In 2030, we will achieve progress for more than one billion people through sustainable \\nscience and technology. By 2030, we will integrate sustainability into all our value chains. By 2040, we will be \\nclimate neutral and reduce our resource consumption. With these goals, we are helping to achieve the UN \\nSustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In order to achieve our sustainability goals, we have defined seven \\nfocus areas: sustainable innovations and technologies for our customers, impact of our technologies and \\nproducts on health and well-being, sustainability culture and values, sustainability and transparency in the \\nsupply chain, securing our social license to operate in all regions, climate change and emissions, and water and \\nresource intensity.  \\n\\nImplementing the sustainability strategy  \\n\\nIn 2022, we focused on creating the right conditions for achieving our sustainability goals. All three business \\nsectors derived sustainability strategies from the overarching company strategy and started executing them.  \\n\\nOn the basis of 14 key indicators, which we defined back in 2021, we record and assess our progress towards \\nachieving our sustainability goals. In 2022, we implemented various digital working tools that we believe will \\nallow us to gain greater transparency with regard to our achievements.  \\n\\nIn the year under review, we specified that also when assessing potential acquisitions, we would always include \\nsustainability aspects. This will be the case even more so in the future, also when it comes to capital allocation \\nand investment decisions as well as research and development. To assess the potential impacts of our products \\nthroughout their entire life cycle, we use a scorecard developed in-house. We introduced this scorecard for all \\nthree of our business sectors in 2022. Moreover, we added a sustainability factor to tour Long-Term Incentive \\nPlan (LTIP) in 2022. Details on how this sustainability factor is calculated can be found in the Compensation \\nReport. \\n\\nWe are now in the process of transforming the company and are integrating sustainability into the innovation \\nprocess and all parts of the value chain. It is our aim to decouple the growth of our businesses from negative \\nenvironmental impacts. \\n\\nMore information on sustainability topics can be found in the Non-Financial Statement, which is also part of \\nthe management report. \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cCombined Management Report ___ Fundamental Information about the Group ___ Strategy \\n\\n30 \\n\\nStrategic finance and dividend policy \\n\\nWe pursue a conservative financial policy characterized by the following: \\n\\nFinancial flexibility and a conservative funding strategy \\n\\nWe ensure that we meet our obligations at all times and adhere to a conservative and proactive funding \\nstrategy that involves the use of various financial instruments. Our diversified and profitable businesses form \\nthe basis for our strong and sustainable cash flow generation capacity. Moreover, we have several funding \\nresources in place. A formerly EUR 2.0 billion syndicated loan facility has been increased to an amount of \\nEUR 2.5 billion in Q4 2022 and now in place until 2027 to cover unexpected cash needs. This credit line is a \\nbackup facility that should only be used in exceptional situations.  \\n\\nMerck also agreed upon several bilateral loan facilities. In addition, we have a commercial paper program with a \\nvolume of € 2 billion at our disposal. Within the scope of this program, we can issue short-term commercial \\npaper with a maturity of up to one year. \\n\\nAdditionally, as a general rule, the bond market represents a key element. The most recent bond issuance took \\nplace in June 2022 (€ 1.0 billion euro bonds) and September 2020 (€ 1.0 billion hybrid bond). The use of \\nvarious instruments provides a broad financing basis and addresses different investor groups. \\n\\nMaintaining long-term and reliable business relations with a core group of banks \\n\\nWe mainly work with a well-diversified, financially stable, and reliable group of banks. Due to our long-term \\nbusiness approach, bank relationships typically last for many years and are characterized by professionalism \\nand trust. The banking group consists of banks with strong capabilities and expertise in various products and \\ngeographical regions. We regard these banks as strategic partners and involve them in important financing \\ntransactions accordingly. \\n\\nStrong investment-grade rating \\n\\nThe rating of our creditworthiness by external rating agencies is an important indicator of financial stability. A \\nstrong investment-grade rating is an important cornerstone of our financial policy, as it safeguards access to \\ncapital markets at attractive financial conditions.  \\n\\nOn October 17, 2022, we received a rating upgrade by Scope Ratings from A- (positive outlook) to A (stable \\noutlook). Also in October 2022, we received rating confirmations from Moody’s (A3, stable outlook) as well as \\nfrom Standard & Poor’s (A, stable outlook). \\n\\nSustainable dividend policy \\n\\nWe are pursuing a sustainable dividend policy. Provided the economic environment develops in a stable \\nmanner, the current dividend represents the minimum level for future dividend proposals. Our dividend policy \\nwill follow business development and earnings increases over the coming years. However, dividend growth \\ncould deviate, for example, within the scope of restructuring or in the event of significant global economic \\ndevelopments. We aim for a target corridor of 20% to 25% of earnings per share pre.\\n\\n \\n \\n\\x0cCombined Management Report ___ Fundamental Information about the Group ___ Internal Management System \\n\\n31  \\n\\nInternal Management System \\n\\nAs a global company with a diverse portfolio of products and services, we use a comprehensive framework of \\nindicators to manage performance. The most important key performance indicator (KPI) for measuring \\nperformance is EBITDA pre1. \\n\\nThe Value Creation and Financial KPI Pyramid, which summarizes our important financial performance \\nmeasures, reflects the comprehensive framework of financial KPIs to steer the businesses and prioritize the \\nallocation of cash resources. It consists of three managerial dimensions: Merck Group, Business, and Projects, \\neach of which requires the use of different indicators.  \\n\\nAbbreviations \\nEBITDA pre 1 = Earnings before interest, income tax, depreciation and amortization as well as adjustments. \\nEPS = Earnings per share.  \\nMEVA 1 = Merck value added. \\nOCF 1 = Operating cash flow.  \\nROCE 1 = Return on capital employed. \\nNPV 1 = Net present value. \\nIRR 1 = Internal rate of return. \\neNPV 1 = Expected net present value. \\nPoS 1 = Probability of success. \\nM&A = Mergers and acquisitions. \\n\\n1 Not defined by International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cCombined Management Report ___ Fundamental Information about the Group ___ Internal Management System \\n\\n32  \\n\\nKey performance indicators of the Group and its businesses \\n\\nThe three key performance indicators of net sales, EBITDA pre, and operating cash flow (OCF) are the most \\nimportant factors for assessing operational performance. Accordingly, we refer to these KPIs in the Report on \\nEconomic Position, the Report on Risks and Opportunities, and the Report on Expected Developments. As the \\nmost important indicators of financial business performance, the KPIs are key elements of our performance \\nmanagement system. \\n\\nNet sales \\n\\nNet sales are defined as the revenues from the sale of goods, services rendered to external customers, and \\ncommission income and profit sharing from collaborations, net of value-added-tax, and after sales deductions \\nsuch as rebates or discounts. Net sales are the main indicator of our business growth and therefore an \\nimportant parameter of external as well as internal performance measurement. In addition, organic sales \\ngrowth compared with the operating plan is used for internal performance management. Organic sales growth \\nshows the percentage change in net sales versus a comparative period, adjusted for exchange rate and \\nportfolio effects. Exchange rate effects may arise as a result of foreign exchange fluctuation between the \\nfunctional non-euro currency of a consolidated company and the reporting currency (euro). By contrast, \\nportfolio effects reflect sales changes due to acquisitions and divestments of consolidated companies or \\nbusinesses. \\n\\nMerck Group \\nNet sales \\n\\n€ million \\n\\nNet sales \\n\\n2022   \\n\\n2021   \\n\\n€ million   \\n\\n% \\n\\n22,232   \\n\\n19,687   \\n\\n2,546   \\n\\n12.9% \\n\\nChange \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n \\n \\n   \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cCombined Management Report ___ Fundamental Information about the Group ___ Internal Management System \\n\\n33  \\n\\nEBITDA pre \\n\\nEBITDA pre is the main performance indicator measuring ongoing operational profitability and is used internally \\nand externally. To permit a better understanding of the underlying operational performance, the operating \\nresult is adjusted to exclude depreciation and amortization, impairment losses and reversals of impairment \\nlosses, as well as adjustments. These adjustments are restricted to the following categories: integration \\nexpenses, IT expenses for selected projects, restructuring expenses, gains/losses on the divestment of \\nbusinesses, acquisition expenses, and other adjustments. The classification of specific income and expenses as \\nadjustments follows clear rules and is subject to strict governance at the Group level.

To optimize the \\nallocation of financial resources, we use a defined set of parameters as criteria for prioritizing investment \\nopportunities and portfolio decisions. \\n\\nNet present value (NPV) \\n\\nThe main criterion for prioritizing investment opportunities is net present value. It is based on the discounted \\ncash flow method and is calculated as the sum of the discounted free cash flows over the duration of a project. \\nThe weighted average cost of capital (WACC), representing the weighted average of the cost of equity and cost \\nof debt, is used as the discount rate. Different markups are applied to the WACC depending on the nature and \\nlocation of the respective project. \\n\\nInternal rate of return (IRR) \\n\\nThe internal rate of return is a further important criterion for the assessment of acquisition projects and \\ninvestments in property, plant and equipment, as well as intangible assets. It is the discount rate that makes \\nthe present value of all future free cash flows equal to the initial investment or the purchase price of an \\nacquisition. A project adds value if the internal rate of return is higher than the weighted cost of capital \\nincluding markups. \\n\\nReturn on capital employed (ROCE) \\n\\nIn addition to NPV and IRR, return on capital employed is an important metric for the assessment of investment \\nprojects when looking at individual accounting periods. It is calculated as the adjusted operating result pre \\n(EBIT pre) divided by the sum of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, trade accounts receivable, \\ntrade accounts payable, and inventories. \\n\\nPayback period \\n\\nAn additional parameter to prioritize investments in property, plant & equipment, and intangible assets is the \\npayback period, which indicates the time in years after which an investment will generate positive net cash \\nflow. \\n\\nMerck value added (MEVA) \\n\\nMerck value added gives information about the financial value created in a period. Value is created when the \\nreturn on capital employed (ROCE) of the company or the business is higher than the weighted average cost of \\ncapital (WACC). MEVA metrics provide us with a powerful tool to weigh investment and spending decisions \\nagainst capital requirements and investors’ expectations. \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cCombined Management Report ___ Fundamental Information about the Group ___ Internal Management System \\n\\n36  \\n\\nCapital market-related parameters \\n\\nNet income, earnings per share (EPS) and earnings per share pre (EPS pre) \\n\\nEarnings per share are calculated by dividing profit after tax attributable to the shareholders of Merck KGaA \\n(net income) by the weighted average number of theoretical shares outstanding. The use of a theoretical \\nnumber of shares takes account of the fact that the general partner’s capital is not represented by shares. To \\nprovide an alternative view, we also report earnings per share pre, in which the effects of integration expenses, \\nIT expenses for selected projects, restructuring expenses, gains/losses on the divestment of businesses, \\nacquisition expenses, and other adjustments are eliminated. Amortization of acquired intangible assets is also \\neliminated. The adjustment excludes impairment losses on intangible assets for acquired research and \\ndevelopment (R&D) projects below a threshold value of € 50 million. Income tax is calculated on the basis of \\nthe Group’s underlying tax rate.

We are working continuously to develop new products and service innovations for patients and \\ncustomers. Indicators of the degree of innovation are defined based on the specifics of the respective \\nbusinesses. \\n\\nSustained employee development \\n\\nWe believe that a diverse workforce strengthens our ability to innovate. We actively promote diversity among \\nour leaders in order to create an integrative culture that reflects our values and enables every employee to \\nfulfill their potential. We ensure that our ambitious corporate goals can be realized through strategic succession \\nplanning for company-critical positions. To gauge the success of the related measures, we have introduced \\nthese two focus issues as non-financial indicators.\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cCombined Management Report ___ Fundamental Information about the Group ___ Research and Development \\n\\n38  \\n\\nResearch and Development\\n\\nScience is at the heart of everything we do. We conduct research and development (R&D) worldwide to develop \\nnew products and services to improve the quality of life of patients and satisfy the needs of our customers. \\nFurther optimizing the relevance and efficiency of our research and development activities – either on our own \\nor in cooperation with third parties – is one of our top priorities. \\n\\nAround 7,700 employees (2021: approximately 8,300) worked in research and development and corresponding \\nsupport functions in 2022. They dealt with innovations to address long-term health and technology trends in \\nboth established and growth markets. \\n\\nExpenditures for R&D amounted to € 2.5 billion in 2022 (2021: € 2.4 billion).  \\n\\nThe organizational setup of our R&D activities reflects our structure with three business sectors. In the \\nLife Science business sector, our research activities focus on developing innovative technologies for laboratory and \\nlife science applications in government and academic labs, the biopharmaceutical industry, and the industrial \\nsector. We continue to focus on digitized and automated labware, DNA purification for downstream applications, \\nand emerging chemical synthesis, as well as software for our BioContinuum™ Platform to accelerate Biopharma \\n4.0. In addition, our teams remain dedicated to delivering advancements in our core portfolios, such as filtration, \\npure lab water, and diagnostic solutions. With our Healthcare business sector’s R&D pipeline, we aspire to make a \\npositive difference for patients – always with the goal to help create, improve, and prolong lives. Our main \\nresearch areas include oncology, immuno-oncology, and immunology including multiple sclerosis. The main focus \\nof our Electronics business sector\\'s research is on the development of innovative materials and technologies \\nrequired for the manufacturing of ever smaller, faster and more powerful processors and memory chips. In \\naddition, Electronics develops novel materials for next-generation displays and functional and decorative effect \\npigments for use in the automotive and cosmetics industries and other industrial applications. \\n\\nWe are deeply convinced that science shouldn’t be conducted in siloes. We believe a modern, multi-disciplinary \\napproach to science will power the next wave of human progress. We call this approach bioconvergence because it \\nleverages synergies across digital and material science as well as biotechnology. Success depends on the ability to \\ncombine a broad mix of competencies and technologies across several disciplines to create novel market solutions. \\nAs a diversified science and technology company with leading positions across life science, healthcare and \\nelectronics, we are in the sweet spot to pioneer this new era. Our goal is to harness synergies not only within our \\nbusiness sectors, but across them to make innovation much faster, more efficient, and far more impactful.  \\n\\nExamples of these opportunities that we are developing at the intersection of our business sectors and \\nconverging technologies include: \\n\\n•  We continue to build our automated design-make-test-analyze platform. This will contribute significantly to \\n\\nrevolutionize drug discovery by accelerating discovery of new and better drug candidates and in turn \\nexpedite timelines for new therapies to reach patients.  \\n\\n•  We are utilizing our capabilities across the group in messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) synthesis, lipid \\n\\nnanoparticle (LNP) synthesis and formulation and targeted delivery, and AI to enable the development of \\n“smarter” LNPs that can more effectively target different tissue types including difficult-to-reach biological \\ntargets in various disease areas.  \\n\\n•  We develop digital twins in smart manufacturing to optimize time, cost, quality, and sustainability. As virtual \\nmodels designed to accurately reflect a physical object or organism, they can help to improve the time, cost, \\nquality, and sustainability of manufacturing, process optimization, and product development. Examples \\ninclude making pharma supply chains more traceable and trustful. We developed a model and together with \\na partner achieved proof-of-concept for pharma primary packaging. Here, authorized stakeholders within the \\nsupply chain get immediate access to quality and process data of products at item level. \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cCombined Management Report ___ Fundamental Information about the Group ___ Research and Development \\n\\n39  \\n\\nHigh-quality, interoperable data combined with analytics and AI offer unprecedented potential for new digital \\nbusiness models adjacent to our current product offering and unlock additional growth opportunities. Examples \\ninclude Syntropy and AthiniaTM, which are partnerships with Palantir.  \\n\\nSyntropy represents a data integration and analytics environment wherein healthcare organizations can \\ncontextualize and analyze infinitely diverse data types securely across their entire ecosystem, enabling experts \\nto collaborate in the fight against cancer and many other diseases. In addition to existing partnerships with, for \\nexample, Mitre, MD Anderson Cancer Center of the University of Texas in Houston, USA, and the University of \\nCalifornia, Irvine, USA, Syntropy partnered with another large NCI-designated academic medical center in the \\nUS on a pilot in 2022. \\n\\nAthiniaTM, launched in December 2021, is targeting the semiconductor industry. It is the only industry-wide \\ncollaborative data ecosystem where multiple companies leverage AI to solve critical challenges by utilizing data \\nto improve supply chain transparency, quality, and reliability of materials, and speed up time to market. In July \\n2022, Micron Technology, a global leader in innovative memory and storage solutions, was announced as a first \\ncustomer. Together, both parties aim to create a pioneering data collaboration ecosystem that will help lead a \\ncontinued journey of digital transformation with Micron’s critical suppliers. \\n\\nResearch and Development Costs \\n\\n€ million \\n\\nLife Science \\n\\nHealthcare \\n\\nElectronics \\n\\nCorporate and Other1 \\n\\nTotal \\n\\nChange \\n\\n2021   \\n\\n€ million   \\n\\n2022   \\n\\n399   \\n\\n1,694   \\n\\n308   \\n\\n119   \\n\\n351   \\n\\n1,712   \\n\\n278   \\n\\n85   \\n\\n2,521   \\n\\n2,426   \\n\\n48   \\n\\n-18   \\n\\n30   \\n\\n34   \\n\\n95   \\n\\n% \\n\\n13.8% \\n\\n-1.0% \\n\\n11.0% \\n\\n39.6% \\n\\n3.9% \\n\\n1 Adjustment of prior-year figure due to a change in functional allocation between administration expenses, research and development costs as well  as \\n\\nother operating expenses.  \\n\\nThe ratio of research expenditure to Group sales was 11.3% (2021: 12.3%).

Our companywide focused leadership approach to pipeline \\nenrichment builds on our established expertise in the underlying biology of our core therapeutic areas of \\noncology, neurology and immunology as well as technological capabilities. By building on our existing strengths \\nand maximizing synergies within our in-house discovered pipeline and with external assets, we will secure \\nsustainable R&D productivity that leads to innovative medicines for patients in need. \\n\\nOncology \\n\\nOncology is a core focus area in our R&D portfolio, as we aim to deliver transformative treatments. \\nTranslational research is embedded into the whole R&D process, with several projects addressing unmet needs \\nin hard-to-treat cancers through innovative treatment approaches and novel combinations. In 2022, we \\nachieved several milestones across our oncology pipeline. \\n\\nWe continue to deliver on our commitment to bring new standards of care for multiple tumor types to as many \\npatients as possible worldwide, with new regulatory approvals of our marketed therapies in additional countries \\naround the world in 2022.  \\n\\nBavencio® (avelumab), an anti-PD-L1 antibody we are co-developing and co-commercializing with Pfizer Inc., \\nUnited States, is now approved as a first-line maintenance treatment for locally advanced or metastatic \\nurothelial carcinoma (UC) in adult patients whose disease has not progressed following platinum-based \\nchemotherapy in 63 countries. Bavencio® was first approved for this indication in the United States by the U.S. \\nFood and Drug Administration (FDA) in June 2020. It is also approved as a monotherapy for the treatment of \\nmetastatic Merkel cell carcinoma in 63 countries and for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma in \\ncombination with axitinib in 60 countries. \\n\\nIn February 2022, the European Commission approved Tepmetko® (tepotinib), our in-house-developed oral \\nMET inhibitor, as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer \\n(NSCLC) harboring alterations leading to mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor gene exon 14 (METex14) \\nskipping, who require systemic therapy following prior treatment with immunotherapy and/or platinum-based \\nchemotherapy. Tepotinib is now available in several countries globally. \\n\\nAs part of our efforts to bring our medicines to as many patients as possible who may benefit from them, we \\nare assessing these medicines in new settings as well, while also progressing promising molecules from our \\npipeline. In 2022, we initiated the Phase II JAVELIN Bladder Medley study in 2022. This randomized umbrella \\nstudy is evaluating whether optimization of first-line maintenance treatment by adding a novel therapy to \\navelumab could improve outcomes for patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma whose disease did not \\nprogress with first-line platinum-containing chemotherapy. JAVELIN Bladder Medley is assessing avelumab \\nmonotherapy versus the combination of avelumab with the company’s investigational anti-TIGIT antibody \\nM6223; avelumab in combination with Nektar Therapeutics’ interleukin-15 (IL-15) receptor agonist, NKTR-255; \\nor avelumab in combination with Gilead Sciences’ Trodelvy® (sacituzumab govitecan-hziy). \\n\\nWith the Phase III development program for the potentially first-in-class IAP (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein) \\ninhibitor xevinapant, we are building on our long-standing leadership in the treatment of squamous cell \\ncarcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). We opened the second Phase III clinical trial, XRay Vision \\n(NCT05386550), a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of \\nxevinapant versus placebo in combination with adjuvant, post-operative radiotherapy in patients with resected \\nlocally advanced (LA) SCCHN who are at high risk for relapse and are ineligible for cisplatin, in 2022. \\n\\n* The contents of this chapter or section are voluntary and therefore not audited.

M9140, which is the first ADC to enter clinical development that is based on our \\nproprietary technology, showed a convincing preclinical profile with high antitumor potency in multiple models \\nand a suitable safety profile. \\n\\nWe shared new data analyses for our marketed and investigational oncology medicines throughout the year at \\nmajor congresses.  \\n\\nAt the 2022 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) annual Genitourinary Cancers Symposium, February \\n17-19, we presented results of an exploratory analysis from the Phase III JAVELIN Bladder 100 trial with 19 \\nadditional months of follow-up data from the initial primary analysis. This analysis reinforced the original results \\nand showed that Bavencio® plus best supportive care (BSC) in the first-line maintenance setting prolonged \\nmedian overall survival by 8.8 months versus BSC alone for patients with locally advanced or metastatic UC \\nwhose tumors had not progressed on a platinum-based chemotherapy. \\n\\nIn June, 30 abstracts featuring key data from our broad oncology clinical portfolio were presented at the ASCO \\nAnnual Meeting. Highlights included: \\n\\nNew analyses of long-term data from the Phase III JAVELIN Bladder 100 study of Bavencio® as first-line \\nmaintenance treatment in advanced UC, including data from subgroups defined by best response to first-line \\nchemotherapy and in patients who did or did not receive second-line treatment after Bavencio® maintenance. \\n\\nData for the oral MET inhibitor Tepmetko®, including two poster presentations from the VISION trial reporting \\nefficacy, safety and quality-of-life results of Tepmetko® in Asian patients with METex14 skipping NSCLC, and \\nupdated efficacy and safety results of Tepmetko® and exploratory biomarker analyses in patients with NSCLC \\nwith high-level MET amplification enrolled into Cohort B of the VISION trial based on liquid biopsy. \\n\\nAbstracts from key investigator-sponsored studies exploring Erbitux® (cetuximab)-based combinations, \\nincluding the Phase III FIRE-4 study of early switch-maintenance from Erbitux®/FOLFIRI to bevacizumab/5-FU \\nand rechallenge in later lines for patients with RAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), and the \\nPhase II AVETUXIRI study evaluating Bavencio® combined with Erbitux® and irinotecan for refractory \\nmicrosatellite stable mCRC. \\n\\nAt the European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO) Annual Meeting, held September 9-13, we shared 29 \\nabstracts, including five late-breaking oral presentations and two additional mini-oral presentations, \\ndemonstrating the potential to make a transformative impact for patients with cancer.  \\n\\nFor xevinapant, a late-breaking presentation of five-year results from the 96-patient Phase II study showed \\nthat adding xevinapant to chemoradiotherapy (CRT) markedly improved long-term efficacy outcomes in \\npatients with unresected LA SCCHN, more than halving the risk of death over five years compared with placebo. \\nThis is the first randomized trial in decades to show significant improvement in overall survival in patients with \\nLA SCCHN, reinforcing the transformative potential of xevinapant over standard of care in the curative setting.  \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cCombined Management Report ___ Fundamental Information about the Group ___ Research and Development \\n\\n43  \\n\\n• \\n\\nInitial results from the Phase II INSIGHT 2 trial of Tepmetko® plus osimertinib in the treatment of patients \\nwith EGFR-mutant NSCLC with MET amplification after progression on first-line treatment with osimertinib \\nshowed encouraging signs of clinical activity with this targeted, oral, chemotherapy-sparing regimen  \\n\\n•  Data from DDRiver Solid Tumors 301, the first-in-human Phase I study of M1774, our potentially best-in-\\n\\nclass potent and selective inhibitor of ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR), were featured in a mini-\\noral presentation. This research, which showed a favorable safety profile and pharmacologically relevant \\nexposure in patients with advanced solid tumors, exemplify our commitment to advancing understanding of \\nDNA damage response (DDR) inhibition mechanisms. \\n\\n•  For Bavencio®, translational data characterizing genomic biomarkers in peripheral blood from patients \\n\\nenrolled in the Phase III JAVELIN Bladder 100 trial were shared as a late-breaker]. Additional presentations \\nincluded exploratory analyses from JAVELIN Bladder 100 that examined clinical outcomes in long-term \\nresponders with advanced UC treated with Bavencio® first-line maintenance for ≥12 months. \\n\\n•  Additional data for Tepmetko® included results from cohorts A and C in the Phase II VISION trial, which \\n\\ndemonstrated robust and durable efficacy in treatment-naïve and previously treated patients with metastatic \\nNSCLC with METex 14-skipping. In previously treated patients, efficacy was observed regardless of prior \\ntherapies including immunotherapy and/or platinum-based chemotherapy. \\n\\nOn June 3, we announced that, following an interim analysis of the ongoing global Phase II DDRiver SCLC \\n250 trial of berzosertib in combination with topotecan in patients with relapsed, platinum-resistant small cell \\nlung cancer (SCLC), the decision has been made to discontinue the study due to low probability of meeting the \\npre-defined objective of this trial. The safety profile for berzosertib plus topotecan was consistent with that \\nobserved in other clinical trials to date. The ongoing development of our ATR inhibitor M1774 will build on \\nlearnings from the exploration of berzosertib, which has been studied in approximately 1,000 patients to date in \\nmultiple combinations, including with chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy and PARP inhibitors across \\ncompany- and investigator-sponsored studies. \\n\\nTo further support our focused research and development efforts in the area of DDR inhibition, in September \\n2022 we entered a collaboration agreement with licensing option with Nerviano Medical Sciences S.r.l. for the \\nnext-generation highly selective and brain-penetrant PARP1 (poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase) inhibitor NMS-293. \\nNMS-293 has strong potential in combination with a wide variety of DNA-damaging agents, including systemic \\nor targeted chemotherapy (ADCs) or with DDR inhibitors, in numerous tumor types. NMS-293 is in early clinical \\ndevelopment for the treatment of patients with BRCA-mutated tumors as monotherapy and in combination with \\ntemozolomide in recurrent glioblastoma. The option to license this molecule provides us with the optionality to \\ndevelop a next-generation PARP inhibitor in combination with our early pipeline of DDR inhibitors and DNA-\\ndamaging ADCs. \\n\\nNeurology & Immunology \\n\\nMultiple sclerosis (MS) is one of the world’s most common neurological diseases. Despite the emergence of a \\nnumber of therapies in the last two decades, there are still significant unmet needs for people living with MS. As \\na company we have more than 20 years of experience in MS research, and we remain committed to finding \\nsolutions for significant unmet medical needs for those living with the disease. \\n\\nNew data for our investigational treatment evobrutinib, along with Mavenclad® (cladribine tablets) have been \\npresented across key congresses in 2022, including the European Committee for Treatment and Research in \\nMultiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS) Congress in October, the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) Annual Meeting \\nin April and the Americas Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ACTRIMS) Forum in \\nFebruary. \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cCombined Management Report ___ Fundamental Information about the Group ___ Research and Development \\n\\n44  \\n\\nWe presented a total of 39 abstracts at ECTRIMS including data that demonstrated long-term disease stability, \\nshowing annualized relapse rates (ARR) remained low and Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores were \\nstable for people living with RMS treated with evobrutinib in the longest-running and most extensive analysis of \\nany BTK inhibitor in development for RMS. As well, we presented phase IV study highlights improvement in \\nmeasures of Quality of Life in people living with RMS after two years of treatment with Mavenclad®. \\n\\nAt AAN, we presented new Phase II data which showed evobrutinib had sustained low annualized relapse rates \\n(ARRs) and had no new safety signals at 2.5 years. As well, updated safety data continue to demonstrate \\npeople living with MS that were treated with Mavenclad® (cladribine tablets) for their MS who had confirmed or \\nsuspected Covid-19 experienced mild to moderate disease symptoms and no increased risk of serious \\noutcomes. \\n\\nAt ACTRIMS, we presented new Mavenclad® data that showed favorable efficacy outcomes as compared to \\nother oral DMTs, with a lower occurrence of further relapses or disability progression. Additional clinical trial \\ndata show people living with MS treated with Mavenclad® early after a first clinical demyelinating event had a \\nlower occurrence of further relapses or disability progression as compared to placebo. \\n\\nFertility \\n\\nAt the 2022 European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) in July, we announced a clinical \\nstudy for a new innovative smart fertility patient hormone monitoring solution. This is a non-invasive device \\nthat allows hormone monitoring from the comfort of a patient’s home while enabling clinicians to monitor \\nhormone levels remotely as well as to support their clinical decisions. Through this device, we hope to improve \\nboth the patient experience and the efficiency of clinic workflows by increasing convenience and flexibility. The \\nfirst patient enrolled in August.  \\n\\nCardiovascular Metabolism & Endocrinology  \\n\\nThe new formulation of Euthyrox® (levothyroxine) for the treatment of hypothyroidism obtained further \\nregulatory approvals in 2022, resulting in a total of 91 countries where this incremental innovation is \\nregistered, allowing for more precise dosing. \\n\\nGlucophage®, containing the active ingredient metformin, is the drug of choice for first-line treatment of type 2 \\ndiabetes available in more than 100 countries. It is also approved in 69 countries prediabetes when lifestyle \\nintervention is not enough to control the condition. With a successful label extension of Glucophage® and \\nGlucophage® XR in Europe during this year, our metformin products are the first ones that are authorized to be \\nused, in the approved indications, during the pregnancy and around conception. The label update on the \\nmechanism of action, also achieved for EU this year, gives credit to the still growing understanding and \\nopportunities for metformin in the diabetes continuum. \\n\\nConcor®/Concor Cor®, containing bisoprolol, is a beta-blocker for treating hypertension and cardiovascular \\ndiseases such as coronary heart diseases and chronic heart failure. In addition to Concor®/Concor Cor®, the \\nConcor® family offers fixed-dose combinations such as Concor Plus®/Lodoz® (bisoprolol with \\nhydrochlorothiazide) and Concor AM® (bisoprolol with amlodipine). In 2022, Concor® AM, our fixed-dose \\ncombination drug to treat hypertension, has been registered in 68 countries. \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cCombined Management Report ___ Fundamental Information about the Group ___ Research and Development \\n\\n45  \\n\\nEnsuring the supply of our medicines to our patients \\n\\nWe are striving to ensure the supply of our high-quality medicines to patients around the world regardless of \\ncircumstances, while always observing the highest standards of health and safety for our people and partners. \\n\\nSince the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, we have been continuously making every effort to proactively handle \\nthe situation and minimize the impact of the pandemic and also of any challenges from the external context on \\nthe supply of our medicines locally and globally. To this end, we are using three main levers: the thorough \\nimplementation of our business continuity plans across our network and their further development, the active \\nmanagement of our stocks, and the assessment of alternative transportation routes to reach our customers and \\npatients. \\n\\nIn the context of the war in Ukraine, we have taken a number of measures to continue to supply to the best of \\nour ability patients who rely on our medicines in the countries impacted, while ensuring the strictest compliance \\nwith international sanctions. These measures include constantly monitoring and updating our demand plans, \\nbuilding safety stocks locally, accelerating the shipment of goods from our European sites to the countries \\nimpacted and defining back-up air shipment routes in addition to truck transportation to ensure the highest \\nflexibility at all times. \\n\\nBuilding for the future \\n\\nAs part of our commitment to accelerate the discovery and availability of future medicines for patients in need, \\nwe marked the cornerstone laying for our Translational Science Center in July, and for our Launch and \\nTechnology Center in September, at our Darmstadt campus. They are both expected to be fully operational by \\nthe end of 2025 and are part of the € 1.5 billion investment package that we announced in March. \\n\\nThe Translational Science Center, which represents an investment of € 200 million, will be a 30,000 square \\nmeter, fully integrated, multi-use building including laboratories, a lecture hall, and office space allowing \\nscientists from different disciplines to explore new avenues of research in fields ranging from identifying disease \\nbiomarkers to developing targeted therapies. \\n\\nThe Launch and Technology Center, which represents an investment of € 160 million, will offer 13,900 m2 of \\nspace.

As a science \\nand technology company, we offer leading-edge products, services, and solutions that, in many cases, set us \\napart from the competition. Our business units are developing advanced materials for next-generation \\nelectronics. Our Chief Technology Office (CTO) is identifying trends and vetting technologies that are beyond \\nthe time horizon or scope of our business units. As a dedicated technology organization, the CTO is managing \\nresearch partnerships, shaping our technology roadmaps, and managing our long-term R&D portfolio. We have \\nalso created a Technology Leadership Board to review and optimize our technology investment across the \\nbusiness sector. As an essential part of our Level Up growth program, we are investing significantly more than \\n€ 3 billion in innovation and capacity until the end of 2025. With these investments, we are also scaling up our \\nresearch and development capabilities for next-generation semiconductor and display materials to further \\nexpand our position as a leading supplier to the electronics industry. \\n\\nSemiconductor Solutions \\n\\nWe are addressing our customers’ critical material needs through every step of the wafer manufacturing \\nprocess. The outstanding capabilities and competencies of the businesses are diverse and will enable us to \\nbring game-changing innovations for our customers into the market faster. \\n\\nOur Thin Film Solutions business achieved significant progress in advancing critical PORs (Process of Record) \\nand BKMs (Best Known Methods) for both logic and memory devices, by closely partnering with customers and \\nOEMs: we continue to develop innovative solutions for Silicon containing films to address increasingly \\nchallenging problems, make progress in developing high-purity metal-containing precursor offerings enabled by \\nnewly engineered container delivery systems, and focus on developing new spin-on dielectric materials with \\nimproved gap fill and film characteristics for the most advanced semiconductor devices. \\n\\nWith our Specialty Gases, we continue to make progress with our new etch gas technology program, to develop \\nnew chemistries to enable more than 100-layer, single-stack etching for advanced memory devices such as V-\\nNAND. We are also seeing good progress in our etch gas development work for new low-GWP (global warming \\npotential) gases. In August 2022, we announced that we are joining forces with Micron, one of the largest \\nsemiconductor companies in the world, to develop low-GWP gas solutions used in the production of \\nsemiconductors. \\n\\nOur Patterning Solutions business continues to heavily invest in pattern transfer technologies for advanced \\nnodes. The proliferation of extreme ultraviolet lithography is gaining momentum in the industry, and our R&D \\nprograms for pattern collapse, underlayer, directed self-assembly (DSA) and image rectification are showing \\nexcellent progress with key customers. We have engaged in multiple joint development agreements with \\nleading customers and are winning processes of record (PORs) for use of these advanced materials in high-\\nvolume chip manufacturing. We have embarked on a cross-business field program to drive the implementation \\nof organometallic compounds into the photolithography segment. We are seeing strong interactions in hard \\nmasks and resist development with leading Asian customers leading to improved performance. As the need for \\nheterogeneous integration drives advanced wafer packaging technologies, innovation in conventional \\nlithography materials and formulated wet cleans is required. We are collaborating with leading companies to \\nsupport this innovation and have won a new POR supporting hybrid bonding processes. \\n\\nOur Planarization business is driving new product development across advanced oxide and metal segments by \\ncapitalizing on the proximity of our R&D lab to our leading customers in Asia and the United States. We are also \\nleveraging data analytics in product development and quality control to speed up time to market for our \\ncustomers while providing more predictive in-use performance for our customers. More recently, our \\nPlanarization Business focused on introducing industry-leading dielectric and tungsten slurries used in advanced \\nnode DRAM (Dynamic random-access memory) and NAND (flash memory named for the NAND logic gate) \\n\\n* The contents of this chapter or section are voluntary and therefore not audited.

Also, the team has introduced new copper and copper barrier slurries in collaboration with key \\nfoundry and logic customers to enable advanced node logic, analog and multi-layer packaging applications. \\n\\nOur Silicon Valley-based material innovation accelerator Intermolecular saw an increase in the amount of work \\ndone in its labs for quantum computing and neuromorphic computing companies. These companies benefit from \\nthe flexible device processing infrastructure and deep materials knowledge to quickly achieve tangible products \\nin these emerging technology areas. For more than 15 years, Intermolecular has been exploring, testing, and \\ndeveloping advanced materials that are revolutionizing the next generation of electronics. \\n\\nDisplay Solutions \\n\\nOur display materials are enabling the fast-growing market of innovative displays for current and future \\napplications such as foldable smartphones, rollable TVs, or AR/VR (Augmented Reality/Virtual Reality) devices. \\nWith liviFlex™-H, we are providing passivation solutions as protective film to free-form OLED display and are \\nrunning customer qualifications at this moment. Furthermore, we are active in the development of innovative \\nmaterial solutions in close cooperation with customers and partners for next-generation displays, for example \\nmicro-LEDs, low k TFE (Thin Film Encapsulation), and AR/VR displays. \\n\\nOur liquid crystal technology ultra-brightness fringe-field switching (UB-FFS) continues its successful growth, \\nthanks to new product qualifications and rising demand in the liquid crystal displays (LCD) sector for mobile \\ndevices, especially mobile phones, tablet PCs and notebooks. The development of high-resolution 4K and 8K TV \\nsets continues to pose a challenge, as the LCD backlight transmission and efficiency will be reduced due to \\nhigher pixel density. We are therefore actively working to expand our ultra-bright (UB) technology offering with \\nour UBplus liquid crystal materials for the TV market. We are also introducing new mode Chiral-polymer \\nstabilized vertical alignment (C-PS-VA) to boost up the transmittance of PS-VA technology. With such \\ntechnologies, we increase the light transmission efficiency of applications for large-format TV sets and display \\npanels by 10% to 15%. This contributes hugely to the reduction of power consumption and helps our customers \\nand consumers to meet sustainability targets. \\n\\nDeuteration is another key technology we are working on to realize next-generation OLED. Deuterated \\nmaterials have the potential to more than double the lifetime of OLED stacks without compromising on \\nefficiency and voltage. In general, we observe increased lifetime with higher deuteration degrees of the \\nmaterial. We are working with our customers to enable lifetime enhancement, focused on high purity, \\nresponsible consumption of raw materials and supply and process robustness. \\n\\nOur LC-based technology licriOn™ enables extensive connectivity access, even in remote areas where fast \\ninternet connections are unavailable or unaffordable today. As part of our open innovation campaign, we \\ncompleted the Ferroelectric Nematic Liquid Crystals (FNLCs) research challenge. These materials show very \\nunique properties which could enable new, exciting applications like actuators, energy harvesting, memory, \\ncapacitors and supercapacitors. More than 50 researchers around the world submitted application ideas for this \\nfascinating new material already predicted 100 years ago, but only recently were researchers able to confirm \\ntheir existence – a discovery which doesn’t happen all too often. \\n\\nSurface Solutions \\n\\nIn our Surface Solutions business, we focus on the empowerment of our customers to create surfaces that do \\nwhat they need them to do – and look exactly the way they expect them to look. Thus, together with our \\ncustomers, we not only develop product innovations but place more and more focus on new application \\ntechnologies and process excellence to provide customized solutions for the individual challenges of our clients. \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cCombined Management Report ___ Fundamental Information about the Group ___ Research and Development \\n\\n49  \\n\\nIn our automotive pigments business, our pipeline consists of three pillars: product development, application \\nengineering and effect visualization. We are actively working on the extension of our portfolio of Colorstream® \\nmulticolor-effect pigments with outstanding saturation in the bluish red color space as an ideal \\ncomplementation of the existing Colorstream® Lava Red. We will also add a fine light silver Iriodin® pigment to \\nour metallic stylings, offering a unique brightness and opacity. \\n\\nWith the development of a highly-viscous Durazane® polymer, we will extend the application field of anti-\\nscratch and easy-to-clean coatings towards thicker films. With the development of a novel Durazane® \\nformulation, we constantly extend the application field of durable anti-scratch, anti-graffiti and easy-to-clean \\ncoatings. \\n\\nIn addition, we push the boundaries of science and technology to lead our customers on the path to digitization \\nof color evaluation processes. That is why we are implementing a digital setup that allows us to produce highly \\nreliable color data as additional service for our customers. \\n\\nIn our Cosmetics business, we continue to put sustainability at the center of our efforts by focusing more and \\nmore on natural materials in our portfolio. Therefore, we will introduce additional cosmetic active materials \\nfrom botanical sources with unique efficacy addressing anti-aging and anti-inflammatory claims. We also \\nconsidered sustainability in the development of the first range of metal-free metal-look pigments for unique \\ncosmetic effects based on proprietary and novel technology of pigment particle coating. \\n\\nBy broadening our portfolio of inorganic UV filters with two new products based on zinc oxide (ZnO2), we will \\nstrengthen our position as one of the leading UV experts for light protection and tanning. \\n\\nWith the market introduction of additional specialty products for high-security applications, we will also extend \\nour Securalic® portfolio offering our customers more reliable and highly discreet counterfeit detection. \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cCombined Management Report ___ Report on Economic Position ___ Macroeconomic and Sector-Specific Environment \\n\\n50 \\n\\nReport on Economic Position \\n\\nMacroeconomic and Sector-Specific Environment \\n\\nAccording to the latest World Economic Outlook published on January 30, 2023, the International Monetary \\nFund (IMF) states that the current economic challenges will continue to slow down the global economy on a \\nbroad basis and more sharply than previously expected. Global inflation continued to rise significantly during \\n2022 and led to a cost-of-living crisis in many regions. Inflation is forecasted to have reached its peak in late \\n2022, but it is expected to remain elevated for longer than initially anticipated due to ongoing supply shortages \\nand rising energy and food prices. The inflation pressure triggered a tightening of monetary and financial \\nconditions together with a significant appreciation of the U.S. dollar. Further challenges to the global economy \\ninclude, among others, China’s recovery of private consumption and investments in its real estate sector, \\nclimate change, tight labor markets in many countries, as well as geopolitical tensions including the war in the \\nUkraine, the re-alignment of energy supplies and the recent deterioration in China-U.S. relations threatening \\ninternational trade and policy cooperation.     \\n\\nAccording to the latest IMF forecasts, global gross domestic product (GDP) growth slowed from 6.2% in 2021 to \\n3.4% in 2022. The slowdown of economic activity is visible across all economies. Advanced economies \\nregistered a growth of 2.7% (2021: 5.4%) while emerging markets and developing economies saw growth of \\n3.9% (2021: 6.7%). The GDP of the United States grew significantly slower with 2.0% (2021: 5.9%). The euro \\narea recorded a GDP growth of 3.5% in 2022 (2021: 5.3%). The emerging economies of Asia registered a \\ngrowth of 4.3% (2021: 7.4%). The strongest growth driver was India with 6.8% (2021: 8.7%). The GDP \\ngrowth of China slowed down to 3.0% after initial recovery from the impacts of the pandemic in 2021 with \\n8.4% growth. As part of the advanced economies, the GDP of Japan grew by 1.4% (2021: 2.1%). \\n\\nOur organic sales growth was above the IMF’s global growth expectations in 2022 at 6.4%. It was supported by \\nall regions. Europe accounted for the highest share of Group-wide growth with 42.3%, followed by Asia-Pacific \\nwith 24.2%, North America with 17.8%, Latin America with 12.3% and the Middle East and Africa with 3.4%. \\n\\nThe overall growth was predominantly driven by the Life Science business sector, despite declining Covid-\\n19 tailwinds in 2022. Healthcare and Electronics also contributed positively to the organic sales growth. All \\nbusiness sectors supported growth in Europe and Latin America. Growth in the Asia-Pacific region was \\nprincipally the result of operations in the Healthcare and Life Science business sectors while growth in North \\nAmerica was driven by the Life Science and Electronics business sectors. \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cCombined Management Report ___ Report on Economic Position ___ Macroeconomic and Sector-Specific Environment \\n\\n51 \\n\\nDevelopment in 2022 and 2021 \\n\\nLife Science \\n\\nGrowth in market for laboratory products2 \\n\\nGrowth in global sales of biopharmaceutical drugs 2 \\n\\nShare of biopharmaceutical sales in the global pharmaceutical market3 \\n\\nEarly clinical monoclonal antibody (mAb) pipeline growth 4 \\n\\nHealthcare \\n\\nGlobal pharmaceutical market \\n\\nMarket for multiple sclerosis therapies5 \\n\\nMarket for type 2 diabetes therapies5 \\n\\nMarket for fertility treatment5 \\n\\nMarket for the treatment of colorectal cancer 6 \\n\\nElectronics \\n\\nGrowth of wafer area for semiconductor chips \\n\\nGrowth of liquid crystal display surface area7 \\n\\nGlobal sales of cosmetics and care products \\n\\nGlobal number of produced light vehicles \\n\\nChange 20221   \\n\\nChange 2021 \\n\\n4.4%   \\n\\n13.6%   \\n\\n34.6%   \\n\\n7.7%   \\n\\n6.7%   \\n\\n2.0%   \\n\\n18.3%   \\n\\n4.9%   \\n\\n-1.2%   \\n\\n4.9%   \\n\\n-4.5%   \\n\\n15.8%   \\n\\n6.4%   \\n\\n10.4% \\n\\n11.4% \\n\\n33.1% \\n\\n12.6% \\n\\n8.9% \\n\\n-3.4% \\n\\n10.8% \\n\\n28.7% \\n\\n-16.4% \\n\\n14.1% \\n\\n4.3% \\n\\n4.6% \\n\\n3.0% \\n\\n1 Predicted development.

As production of vaccines, \\ntreatments, and tests for the Covid-19 pandemic decline from their peak, robust underlying growth of the core \\n(non-Covid-19) market results in a sustained strong outlook.  \\n\\nAccording to the market research firm Frost & Sullivan, the market for laboratory products, which is relevant to \\nour Science & Lab Solutions business unit, grew 4.4% in 2022 (2021: 10.4%). Given strong core demand but \\nanticipated declining demand for Covid-19 applications compared with strong previous support from additional \\nCovid-19 revenues, the market is expected to grow in the mid-single digits longer term. \\n\\nIn the pharma and biotech production market, in which our Process Solutions and Life Science Services \\nbusiness units are active, demand is driven by the development and manufacture of therapeutics and vaccines. \\nAccording to IQVIA, the end market for biopharmaceuticals grew by 14.3% in 2022 (2021: 12.0%) to \\n€ 452 billion (or 35.4% of the global pharmaceutical market). Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), currently the \\nleading area of biopharmaceuticals, continued to develop positively in 2022 with the number of molecules in \\nphase 1 or 2 development growing by 7.7% (2021: 12.6%). This deceleration in year-over-year growth reflects \\na normalization from pandemic-era peaks in phase 1/2 pipeline growth for mAbs, viral gene therapies, and \\nother recombinant proteins. For mAbs, year-over-year growth in the early-stage clinical pipeline remains similar \\nto pre-pandemic rates (average 8.8% annual growth from 2018-2020). \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n   \\n \\n   \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cCombined Management Report ___ Report on Economic Position ___ Macroeconomic and Sector-Specific Environment \\n\\n52 \\n\\nHealthcare \\n\\nIn its latest study from September, the pharmaceutical market research firm IQVIA forecasts growth of 6.7% in \\n2022 (2021: 8.9%) for the global overall pharmaceutical market. With continued recovery from the Covid-19 \\npandemic, the pharmaceutical market is expected to see still high growth rates benefitting from accelerated \\napproval pathways and increased access to innovative drugs globally. This is balanced by increasing cost \\ncontainment measures driving biosimilar and generics uptake as well as stricter price reviews and prescription \\ncontrols. \\n\\nThe developments at a regional level follow the described trend. EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa) grew \\n7.5% in 2022 (2021: 7.7%) with the EU5 growing at 7.3% (2021: 8.2%). North America grew 7.0% (2021: \\n7.8%) with the United States recording the same growth rate of 7.0% (2021: 7.8%). In absolute terms, the \\npharmaceutical market in the United States remains the biggest and most important market by far. Latin \\nAmerica achieved double-digit growth of 16.5% (2021: 24.9%) followed by the Asia-Pacific region (excluding \\nChina and Japan) with 8.6% growth (2021: 11.4%). China is an exception with an assumed negative growth of \\n-1.8% in 2022 (2021: 7.6%) driven by regional and local lockdowns due to Covid-19 and continued extension \\nof price regulations (for example, volume-based procurement) despite increasing access to innovative products \\nand enlarged healthcare infrastructure. \\n\\nNot only the growth of the pharmaceutical sector as a whole, but also the market development for \\nbiotechnologically produced active ingredients is relevant to our business. As previously stated, the market \\nvolume for biological pharmaceuticals totaled approximately € 452 billion in 2022 (2021: approximately \\n€ 396 billion) according to IQVIA, thus continuing the increase in market share of recent years. These products \\naccounted for 35.4% of the global pharmaceutical market in 2022 (2021: 33.6%). The most important market \\nfor biological pharmaceuticals remains the United States, with a 63.2% share of global biopharmaceutical \\nmarket volumes. \\n\\nThe developments in the therapeutic areas of relevance to Merck saw differing trends in the reporting year. The \\nglobal market for type 2 diabetes excluding the United States and Russia followed the growth trend of previous \\nyears and accelerated growth, achieving 18.3% in 2022 (2021: 10.8%). The therapeutic area of infertility grew \\n4.9% in the reporting year (2021: 28.7%) after a significant recovery in 2021 from the pandemic in which, for \\nexample, clinics were partially closed. Colorectal cancer further declined by -1.2% in 2022 (2020: -16.4%) due \\nto biosimilar penetration. The growth trend in the market for multiple sclerosis therapies improved compared \\nwith the previous year level of 2.0% (2021: -3.4%), as new product launches counteracted the effect of market \\ndecline due to generic competition. \\n\\nElectronics \\n\\nThe semiconductor industry is the most important market for our business with materials, solutions and \\nservices for the production of integrated circuits (Semiconductor Solutions). In particular, the growth in demand \\nfor semiconductor materials depends mainly on the wafer area produced for semiconductors. The silicon wafers \\nrequired as raw materials are used as an indicator to estimate the demand for semiconductor materials overall. \\nAccording to the global industry association SEMI, the area of delivered silicon wafers grew by 4.9% in 2022, \\nafter strong growth in 2021 (14.1%). While demand for electronic devices is normalizing after the Covid-19-\\ninduced investment and upgrade cycle in 2020 and 2021, the ongoing trend of digitization and the required \\ndigital infrastructure (network, servers, 5G) continues. Semiconductors are a key component for many \\napplications including communications, consumer electronics, automotive, transportation, clean energy, \\naerospace, and defense.  \\n\\nDriven by the aforementioned acceleration of digitization and the corresponding exponential data growth, there \\nis a continuing need for semiconductors across all device end-markets. The high demand for and importance of \\nsemiconductors is clearly visible in the recent slow easing of the global chip bottleneck shortage and their \\ngeopolitical relevance. For this reason, all major chip manufacturers increased and accelerated their investment \\nplans for new fabs and additional capacities. Combined with ongoing technology upgrades, these investments \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cCombined Management Report ___ Report on Economic Position ___ Macroeconomic and Sector-Specific Environment \\n\\n53 \\n\\nwill lead to rising demand for innovative materials. Our targeted semiconductor materials market is expected to \\nhave a strong long-term growth, with some cyclicality. \\n\\nWith our Liquid Crystals business, we are a leading producer of liquid crystal mixtures for the display industry. \\nAfter the Covid-19-induced “stay at home boom” the display industry is undergoing demand normalization. The \\nmarket research company OMDIA (forecast Q3 2022) forecasts a market decline in 2022. In the medium to \\nlong term, liquid crystals will continue to play a key role in the display industry in the future. OLED technology, \\nfor which we are also one of the leading material suppliers, is becoming increasingly important in high-end \\ndisplay applications. \\n\\nThe markets for automotive coatings and cosmetics are crucial to our Surface Solutions business. According to \\nLMC, a leading global provider of automotive forecasts, global automobile production grew by 6.4% in 2022 \\nafter 3.0% growth in 2021 and a strong dip in 2020. The market is expected to continue with 4.8% growth in \\n2023, reaching 2019 production volumes in 2024. Underlying drivers include an ongoing latent global demand \\nrelated to Covid-19 and a reduction in supply chain problems of recent years. China continues to be one of the \\nmost important markets. The market for cosmetics and care products showed a continuing, very strong \\ndevelopment with an overall growth of 15.8% in 2022 (2021: 4.6%) following the dip in 2020. After the \\nnegative effects of Covid-19 regarding lockdowns and social distancing and increased trade conflicts between \\nthe United States and China last year, Euromonitor, a leading global provider of market research, expects the \\nmarket growth to be sustainable at ~4-6% per year until 2026.\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cCombined Management Report ___ Report on Economic Position ___ Review of Forecast against Actual Business Developments \\n\\n54 \\n\\nReview of Forecast against Actual Business \\nDevelopments \\n\\nThe forecast of the Merck Group for fiscal 2022 published in the Annual Report for fiscal 2021 comprised the \\nforecast for the Group as well as the forecast for the three business sectors: Life Science, Healthcare, and \\nElectronics. \\n\\nNet sales \\n\\nWe forecast strong organic net sales growth for the Group in 2022. In particular, the geopolitical and economic \\nconditions changed in the course of the year. Additionally, renewed outbreaks of Covid-19 in China and the \\nzero-Covid strategy pursued by the Chinese government meant that temporary, locally restricted lockdowns \\nwere imposed there. Driven by the sustained dynamic organic growth of the Life Science business sector in \\nparticular, we recorded organic growth in net sales of 6.4% in fiscal 2022, thus falling within our forecast range \\nlast revised to organic sales growth of between +6% and +8% with the publication of the figures for the third \\nquarter. At the start of the year, we still anticipated positive exchange rate effects of between +1% and +4% \\non our net sales. However, several currencies saw more favorable development than expected as the year \\nprogressed, particularly the U.S. dollar and the Chinese renminbi. The positive exchange rate effect in 2022 as \\na whole was +6.1%, thus falling within the range of between +5% and +8% set out in our most recent update \\nin the third quarter. The slightly positive portfolio effect was negligible at +0.4%. All in all, net sales amounted \\nto € 22,232 million, representing a year-on-year increase of +12.9%. \\n\\nLife Science \\n\\nOur Life Science business sector generated organic sales growth of 8.2% in 2022, this falling within the forecast \\nrange of +7% to +10% that was specified in the first quarter. This meant that Life Science also achieved the \\noriginal forecast of strong organic sales growth. This development was driven by all three business units, \\nnamely Process Solutions, Life Science Services and Science & Lab Solutions. As expected, Process Solutions \\nwas again the most dynamic business unit, delivering the largest contribution to the organic sales growth within \\nLife Science. All in all, net sales in the Life Science business sector increased by 15.4% to € 10,380 million, \\nincluding a positive exchange rate effect of 6.4% and a positive portfolio effect of 0.8%. \\n\\nHealthcare \\n\\nWe originally forecast solid organic sales growth for our Healthcare business sector compared with the previous \\nyear. We then quantified this organic sales growth forecast at between +4% and +7% when we published the \\nfigures for the first quarter. Having retained this forecast, we achieved it with organic growth of +5.5% in fiscal \\n2022. This development was driven in particular by the significant growth contribution from oncology business \\nand, above all, strong growth in our recently approved product Bavencio®. Neurology & Immunology also made \\na substantial contribution to organic sales growth thanks to our recently approved product Mavenclad® in \\nparticular. As we originally forecast for fiscal 2022, we returned to solid organic sales growth in the \\nCardiovascular, Metabolism and Endocrinology franchise. Taking into account a positive exchange rate effect of \\n5.1%, net sales in the Healthcare business sector increased by 10.6% to € 7,839 million in fiscal 2022.  \\n\\nElectronics \\n\\nSince we anticipated positive development in semiconductor business, we forecast solid to strong organic sales \\ngrowth for our Electronics business sector at the start of the year. We quantified our organic sales growth \\nforecast at between +5% and +8% when we published the figures for the first quarter. In addition to various \\neconomic and geopolitical factors leading to an expected slowdown in growth in the Semiconductor Solutions \\nbusiness in the second half of the year compared with the previous forecast, our Display Solutions business saw \\nweaker organic growth in the third quarter. Accordingly, we lowered our forecast for the Electronics business \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cCombined Management Report ___ Report on Economic Position ___ Review of Forecast against Actual Business Developments \\n\\n55 \\n\\nsector to organic sales growth of between +2% and +5% with the publication of the figures for the third \\nquarter. The business sector achieved this reduced forecast with organic sales growth of 3.7%. Thanks to \\npositive exchange rate effects of 7.6%, the Electronics business sector increased its net sales by 11.3% year-\\non-year to € 4,013 million.  \\n\\nEBITDA pre \\n\\nFor 2022, we originally forecast strong year-on-year organic growth in EBITDA pre for the Merck Group. This \\nassumption was based on the expectation of strong organic growth in Life Science, moderate to solid growth in \\nHealthcare, and solid organic growth in Electronics. Because of the expected favorable foreign exchange \\nenvironment, we originally expected positive exchange rate effects to impact EBITDA pre by between +2% and \\n+5% compared with the prior year. With the presentation of the figures for the first quarter, we quantified our \\nforecast for organic growth in EBITDA pre at between +5% and +9%. Thanks to positive exchange rate effects, \\nespecially from the U.S. dollar and the Chinese renminbi, we raised our forecast for the impact of exchange rate \\neffects on EBITDA pre twice in the course of fiscal 2022, ultimately ending with a forecast of between +6% and \\n+10%. EBITDA pre amounted to € 6,849 million in fiscal 2022, representing a total increase of 12.2% \\ncompared with the previous year. At +6.1%, organic sales growth fell within our forecast range of between \\n+5% and +9%. Positive exchange rate effects amounted to +6.4%, thereby coming in at the lower end of our \\nfinal forecast range. The slightly negative portfolio effect was negligible at -0.3%. \\n\\nLife Science \\n\\nIn line with the anticipated strong organic revenue growth in Life Science, we also forecast strong organic \\ngrowth in EBITDA pre in this business sector. We quantified our forecast for organic growth in EBITDA pre at \\nbetween +6% and +10% in the first quarter and raised it to between +8% and +11% with the publication of \\nthe figures for the second and third quarter. In addition to reflecting the more precise forecast range for net \\nsales growth in the Life Science business sector, this range takes account of the dynamic development of \\ndemand, the accompanying operating levers, and the product mix. With EBITDA pre of € 3,760 million in fiscal \\n2022 (2021: € 3,286 million) and year-on-year organic growth of 9.7%, the business sector’s earnings \\nperformance fell within the forecast range. Exchange rate effects had an additional positive effect of 5.1% on \\nEBITDA pre compared with fiscal 2021. The slightly negative portfolio effect was negligible at -0.4%. \\n\\nHealthcare \\n\\nWe forecast moderate to solid organic growth in EBITDA pre for our Healthcare business sector on the back of \\nsubstantial expected earnings contributions from our new products, especially Mavenclad®, as well as the \\ndecline in marketing and selling expenses and research and development costs as a proportion of sales thanks \\nto systematic cost management and strict pipeline prioritization. Largely because of the absence of non-\\nrecurring effects from the previous year, this original forecast was slightly below the expected organic growth in \\nnet sales (solid organic sales growth). With the publication of the figures for the first quarter, we quantified our \\nforecast for organic growth in EBITDA pre at between +3% and +5% in fiscal 2022. This forecast was \\nsubsequently retained. We ultimately recorded year-on-year organic growth in EBITDA pre of +3.3% in fiscal \\n2022, thus falling within the forecast range. Exchange rates had an additional positive effect of 11.7% on \\nEBITDA pre compared with the previous year, thereby coming in at the lower end of the most recent forecast \\nrange of between +12% and +15%.  \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cCombined Management Report ___ Report on Economic Position ___ Review of Forecast against Actual Business Developments \\n\\n56 \\n\\nElectronics \\n\\nFor the Electronics business sector, we originally anticipated solid organic growth in EBITDA pre in fiscal 2022. \\nWe expected the growth in Semiconductor Solutions to more than offset falling prices for liquid crystals with the \\nsupport of active price and cost management. In response to greater adverse effects from increased raw \\nmaterial and logistics costs, which we were only able to partially offset by taking countermeasures, we \\nquantified our forecast range for organic EBITDA pre growth at between +0% and +4% with the presentation \\nof the figures for the first quarter. After initially adjusting our forecast range slightly to between +0% and +3% \\nwith the publication of the figures for the second quarter, we lowered it significantly to a year-on-year decrease \\nof between -7% and -10% when the figures for the third quarter were presented. The main reasons for this \\ndevelopment were a higher projected downturn in demand as well as falling prices for liquid crystals. \\nElectronics recorded EBITDA pre of € 1,192 million across 2022 as a whole (2021: € 1,128 million). This \\nrepresented a year-on-year organic decline of -7.3%, which was at the upper end of our forecast range. \\nExchange rates had an additional positive effect of 13% on EBITDA pre compared with fiscal 2022 (most recent \\nforecast range +13% to +16%).  \\n\\nCorporate and Other \\n\\nThe expenses for Corporate and Other in EBITDA pre amounted to € -579 million in fiscal 2022. This was in line \\nwith the most recent forecast range of between € -570 million and € -600 million but higher than the forecast \\nrange issued with the publication of the figures for the first quarter, which was between € -510 million and € -\\n570 million. The amended forecast range reflects the changed assumptions regarding exchange rate \\ndevelopments and the associated expected negative effects of currency hedging transactions, which partially \\noffset the positive foreign exchange effects in the business sectors. Compared with the prior-year figure of € -\\n465 million, this corresponded to an increase in costs of 24.7%.  \\n\\nOperating cash flow \\n\\nWe originally anticipated a significant year-on-year increase in the operating cash flow of the Merck Group in \\n2022 (2021: € 4,616 million). We quantified this forecast at between € 4,500 million and € 5,100 million with \\nthe presentation of the figures for the first quarter in order to reflect an increase in working capital as well as \\nthe expected payments within the scope of the ongoing transformation and growth programs in fiscal 2022 \\n(especially in the Healthcare and Electronics business sectors). The operating cash flow amounted to \\n€ 4,259 million in fiscal 2022, which was lower than the quantified forecast range of between € 4,500 million \\nand € 5,100 million. In addition to the reasons already mentioned this was mainly due to the higher tax \\npayments.\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cCombined Management Report ___ Report on Economic Position ___ Review of

This positive development was attributable to organic net \\nsales growth of € 1,262 million or 6.4% and was driven by all of the Group’s business sectors. Positive foreign \\nexchange effects, which resulted primarily from the development of the U.S. dollar and the Chinese renminbi, \\nled to an increase in net sales of € 1,208 million or 6.1% in fiscal 2022. The portfolio-related net sales increase \\nof € 76 million or 0.4% mainly resulted from the acquisition of Exelead Inc., United States, which closed on \\nFebruary 22, 2022. \\n\\nThe net sales in the individual quarters as well as the respective organic growth rates in 2022 are presented in \\nthe following graph: \\n\\nMerck Group \\n\\nNet sales and organic growth1 by quarter2 \\n€ million/organic growth in % \\n\\n1 Not defined by International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). \\n2 Quarterly breakdown unaudited. \\n\\nNet sales in the Life Science business sector increased by € 1,389 million or 15.4% year-on-year to \\n€ 10,380 million (2021: € 8,992 million). This development was attributable to organic growth of 8.2%, which \\nwas supported by a positive foreign exchange effect of 6.4% and an increase in net sales of 0.8% due to the \\nacquisition of Exelead Inc., United States. Accounting for 47% of Group sales (2021: 46%), Life Science was \\nthe strongest business sector in terms of net sales. It was followed by Healthcare with 35% of Group sales \\n(2021: 36%), where net sales rose by € 750 million or 10.6% to € 7,839 million in the year under review \\n(2021: € 7,089 million).

The € 407 million or 11.3% increase in net sales in the Electronics business sector to € 4,013 million \\n(2021: € 3,606 million) resulted from organic net sales growth of 3.7% and positive foreign exchange effects of \\n7.6%.

This \\nwas due to higher other operating expenses, which were significantly influenced by impairment losses on non-\\nfinancial assets and a negative currency result from cash flow hedging as well as higher expenses for profit \\nshare agreements in the Healthcare business sector. In addition, other operating income declined as a result of \\nlower upfront, milestone and license payments in the Healthcare business sector in particular (see explanations \\nunder “Healthcare”). Detailed information about the development and composition of other operating expenses \\nand income can be found in Note (13) “Other operating income” and Note (14) “Other operating expenses” \\nin the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \\n\\nThe 7.1% increase in the operating result (EBIT) to € 4,474 million (2021: € 4,179 million) was mainly driven \\nby the positive development of gross profit. \\n\\nAn increase in provisions for obligations under long-term variable compensation programs (Merck Long-Term \\nIncentive Plan) had an adverse effect on the operating result in the year under review, with the rise in the \\nintrinsic value of the Merck Share Units being reflected in the respective functional costs depending on the area \\nof activity of the plan beneficiaries. \\n\\nThe financial result improved by 26.7% to € -187 million in fiscal 2022 (2021: € -255 million). This was due in \\nparticular to the positive development of net interest income compared with the previous year. Details about \\nthe Group’s financial income and expenses can be found in Note (40) “Finance income and expenses/Net \\ngains and losses from financial instruments” in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \\n\\nIncome tax expense amounted to € 948 million in 2022 (2021: € 859 million) and resulted in a tax rate of \\n22.1% (2021: 21.9%). Further information on income taxes can be found in Note (15) “Income tax” in the \\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \\n\\nThe net income attributable to Merck KGaA shareholders increased by 8.9% to € 3,326 million (2021: \\n€ 3,055 million) and resulted in an improvement in earnings per share to € 7.65 in fiscal 2022 (2021: € 7.03). \\n\\nEBITDA pre, the key financial indicator used to steer operating business, rose by € 746 million or 12.2% to \\n€ 6,849 million (2021: € 6,103 million).

However, growing geopolitical tensions mean that Merck remains \\ncompelled to respond to various challenges and uncertainties around the world. Nevertheless, the strong \\nbusiness performance in fiscal 2022 once again served to underline Merck’s impressive resilience in difficult \\ntimes, which has always proved to be an important competitive advantage in the past.  \\n\\nOur ‘Big 3’ growth drivers – Process Solutions and Life Science Services in the Life Science business sector, new \\nproducts from the Healthcare development pipeline, and Semiconductor Solutions in the Electronics business \\nsector – made a particularly important contribution to our success. The Merck Group generated sales growth in \\nall regions in its three business sectors. All in all, the Merck Group increased its net sales by 12.9% or \\n€ 2.5 billion to € 22.2 billion in fiscal 2022. With organic growth of 6.4% or € 1.3 billion, we reached an \\nimportant milestone on the way to achieving our medium-term growth target of sales of around € 25 billion by \\n2025. Our most important key performance indicator, EBITDA pre, increased by 12.2% to € 6.8 billion. In light \\nof our successful performance in fiscal 2022, we will propose to the Annual General Meeting that the dividend \\npayment be increased by 19% to € 2.20 per share.  \\n\\nThe solid financing policies of the Merck Group were reflected in its consistently good key balance sheet figures. \\nThe equity ratio was an impressive 53.6% as of December 31, 2022 (December 31, 2021: 47.2%). Net \\nfinancial debt was reduced further, amounting to € 8.3 billion at the end of the fiscal year.  \\n\\nMerck’s extremely successful business performance allowed it to continue to expand its excellent financial \\nflexibility. This forms the basis for realizing our ambitious investment and growth plans and means we are still \\nplanning to increase total investments between 2021 and 2025 by more than 50% compared with the previous \\nfive-year period.  \\n\\nBased on our solid net assets and financial position as well as our profitable operations, we view the economic \\nsituation of the Merck Group as positive overall. Thanks to our resilient business model and our clear \\npositioning as a science and technology company, we are well positioned even in economically challenging \\ntimes.\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cCombined Management Report ___ Report on Economic Position ___ Life Science \\n\\n71 \\n\\nLife Science \\n\\nLife Science \\nKey figures1 \\n\\n€ million \\n\\nNet sales \\n\\nOperating result (EBIT)2 \\n\\nMargin (% of net sales)2 \\n\\nEBITDA3 \\n\\nMargin (% of net sales)2 \\n\\nEBITDA pre2 \\n\\nMargin (% of net sales)2 \\n\\n2022   \\n\\n2021   \\n\\n€ million   \\n\\nChange \\n\\n10,380   \\n\\n2,808   \\n\\n27.1%   \\n\\n3,678   \\n\\n35.4%   \\n\\n3,760   \\n\\n36.2%   \\n\\n8,992   \\n\\n2,480   \\n\\n27.6%   \\n\\n3,258   \\n\\n36.2%   \\n\\n3,287   \\n\\n36.6%   \\n\\n1,389   \\n\\n328   \\n\\n% \\n\\n15.4% \\n\\n13.2% \\n\\n420   \\n\\n12.9% \\n\\n473   \\n\\n14.4% \\n\\n1 Prior-year figures have been adjusted due to product reallocations between the Life Science and Electronics business sectors. \\n\\n2 Not defined by International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). \\n\\n3 Not defined by International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS); EBITDA corresponds to operating result (EBIT) adjusted by  depreciation, \\n\\namortization, impairment losses, and reversals of impairment losses.  \\n\\nDevelopment of sales and results of operations \\n\\nIn fiscal 2022, Life Science generated organic sales growth of 8.2%.

This was mainly driven by growth in \\nthe core business amid a decline in pandemic-related demand. Including a favorable foreign exchange effect of \\n6.0%, net sales amounted to € 4,898 million (2021: € 4,367 million). Science & Lab Solutions thus accounted \\nfor 47% of Life Science net sales (2021: 48%). Organic sales growth was mainly driven by Asia-Pacific and \\nNorth America. \\n\\nThe Process Solutions business unit, which markets products and services for the pharmaceutical production \\nvalue chain, generated organic sales growth of 10.9%. While pandemic-related business declined as expected, \\nthe performance of the core business was robust. Including a favorable foreign exchange effect of 6.6%, net \\nsales increased to € 4,526 million in 2022 (2021: € 3,853 million). The percentage contribution of the \\nProcess Solutions business unit to Life Science net sales was 44% (2021: 43%). In regional terms, mainly \\nEurope and North America contributed to the organic sales growth within Process Solutions.  \\n\\nThe Life Science Services business unit, which offers fully integrated Contract Development and Manufacturing \\nOrganization (CDMO) and Contract Testing services, accounted for a 9% share of Life Science net sales (2021: \\n9%).

Adjusted administration expenses increased by 14.1% \\nto € 377 million (2021: € 331 million) owing to additional expenses to support our sustainability strategy as \\nwell as our organic transformation. Adjusted research and development costs increased by 14.3% to \\n€ 399 million (2021: € 349 million) driven mainly by our core growth areas. In addition to organic \\ndevelopments, unfavorable foreign exchange effects impacted the development of costs compared to 2021. \\nAfter eliminating adjustments, amortization and depreciation, EBITDA pre rose by 14.4% to € 3,760 million \\n(2021: € 3,287 million).

The prior-year figure was positively impacted by the temporary partnership with Eli Lilly \\nand Company, United States, which led to net sales of € 59 million in the North America region. Organic growth \\nwas driven in particular by the Asia-Pacific region, which recorded organic growth of 9.1% and net sales \\ntotaling € 441 million (2021: € 391 million), as well as the similarly important Europe region, where organic \\ngrowth amounted to 4.8% and net sales totaled € 434 million (2021: € 417 million). Encouraging development \\nwas also recorded in the Latin America region, with organic growth of 26.3% and total net sales of € 85 million \\n(2021: € 71 million), and the Middle East and Africa region, with organic growth of 23.3% and net sales of \\n€ 62 million (2021: € 49 million).  \\n\\nThanks to strong organic growth of 57.9% and positive foreign exchange effects of 5.8%, net sales of the \\noncology drug Bavencio® rose to € 611 million (2021: € 373 million). All regions contributed to this encouraging \\ndevelopment, which was mainly driven by further growth in the drug’s market share for first-line maintenance \\ntreatment for patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (UC).  \\n\\nMavenclad®, for the oral short-course treatment of highly active relapsing multiple sclerosis (MS), saw organic \\nsales growth of 16.9% in fiscal 2022.

At 75.5%, the resulting gross margin was at almost the same level as in the 2021 reporting \\nperiod (2021: 75.8%).  \\n\\nAdjusted marketing and selling expenses increased by 2.4% year-on-year to € 1,631 million (2021: € 1,593 million). \\nThe -5.0% reduction in research and development costs to € 1,622 million (2021: € 1,707 million) was due in part to \\nthe comparatively high cost base in the previous year as a result of the provisions that were recognized for \\nsubsequent costs from the near-complete discontinuation of the bintrafusp alfa program and the associated cost \\nsavings. The termination of the global Phase II study of the drug candidate berzosertib, which was announced in the \\nsecond quarter of 2022, also led to cost savings. Adjustments to research and development costs in the amount of \\n€ 73 million primarily related to costs for transformation programs. The reduction in other operating expenses and \\nincome to € -198 million (2021: € 59 million) was mainly due to the final earnings effect of € 123 million in the \\nprevious year from the receipt of the previously deferred upfront cash payment for the global strategic alliance with \\nGlaxoSmithKline plc, United Kingdom (GSK), to co-develop and co-commercialize bintrafusp alfa, as well as higher \\nprofit transfers from the strategic alliance with Pfizer Inc., United States, to develop and commercialize Bavencio®. In \\naddition, the figure for the previous year included milestone payments of around € 50 million for the approvals of \\nBavencio® in Europe and Japan as a first-line maintenance treatment for patients with locally advanced or metastatic \\nurothelial carcinoma (UC).

The adjusted gross profit margin declined \\nslightly to 42.9% (2021: 43.5%) as positive foreign exchange effects and increased pricing discussed above \\nwere not enough to cover the rising costs of materials and other inflationary cost increases. Further pressure on \\ngross profit and margin arose from a negative product mix caused by a temporary loss of high-margin liquid \\ncrystals sales while our customers significantly reduced their factory utilization. Adjusted marketing and selling \\nexpenses increased by 16.0% as global shipping capacity constraints and increasing fuel costs drove \\nsignificantly higher logistics expenses.

For us, risks and opportunities management are hence an imperative and a core component \\nof our internal business planning and forecasting. We have put in place clear processes, appropriate tools, \\nand fixed responsibilities to enable early identification of risks to derive effective and efficient mitigation \\nstrategies. In our internal risk reporting framework, we define risks as potential future events or \\ndevelopments that could result in unfavorable deviation from our financial and non-financial targets. Risk \\nparameters in this context are the probability of financial (quantitative) impact (EBITDA pre/Operating \\nCash Flow) or non-financial (qualitative) impact (reputation/brand, Environment, Social, Governance \\n(ESG) including Workforce and Ethics, Strategy, Operations). \\n\\nMeanwhile, opportunities imply a favorable deviation from targets. Future events and expected \\ndevelopments are considered in internal planning if a likely occurrence can be assumed within the \\nplanning period. The following section presents the risks and opportunities that could result in favorable \\nand unfavorable deviations from existing plans and targets. \\n\\nFor additional information and details regarding the non-financial topics, please refer to the Non-Financial \\nStatement.  \\n\\nRisk and opportunity management \\n\\nGroup Controlling & Risk Management forms the organizational framework for risk management and reports to \\nthe Group Chief Financial Officer. Within the scope of audits, Group Internal Auditing regularly reviews the \\nperformance of risk management processes within the units on local level and, at the same time, the \\ncommunication of relevant risks from the operating businesses to Group Risk Management. Furthermore, the \\nexternal auditor reviews the risk early warning system during the annual audit of the financial statements.  \\n\\nThe objective of our risk management activities is to identify, assess and manage risks in a timely manner so \\nthat appropriate measures can be implemented to mitigate their potential negative impact. Our internal risk \\nmanagement guidelines detail the responsibilities, objectives, and processes of risk management. The business \\nheads, managing directors of Merck subsidiaries, and the heads of Group functions are appointed as “risk \\nowners”, who run local risk management processes. Requirements for local risk management are risk \\nidentification taking all internal and external influences into consideration (impacting financial or non-financial \\ntargets), risk analysis, risk mitigation by appropriate actions, definition of preventive measures and emergency \\nplans if applicable, and documentation of risks and mitigation actions.  \\n\\nThe risk owners regularly assess the risk status and report their risk portfolio to Group Risk Management. We \\nuse special risk management tools to manage and support these activities. Group Risk Management coordinates \\nand supervises the bottom-up risk reporting, confirming the plausibility of the reported risk, evaluates the \\nmitigation measures and the planned time frames, and determines the residual risk, which is presented as net \\nrisk in the internal risk report.  \\n\\nFor the internal bottom-up risk reporting process, reporting is based on defined thresholds, and a variety of \\ndistribution functions are used to reflect scenarios with varied occurrence probabilities. Risks below the global \\nreporting threshold are managed and monitored locally. The timeframe applied for internal risk reporting is five \\nyears. It can go beyond five years in special cases, e.g., for regulatory risks related to climate change. The \\n\\n \\n\\x0cCombined Management Report ___ Report on Risks and Opportunities \\n\\n86 \\n\\noutlined risks and their evaluation are based on respective annual values in the reporting time frame. The \\nassessment of the risks presented relates to December 31, 2022. There were no relevant changes after the \\nbalance sheet date that would have necessitated an amended presentation of the risk situation of the Group. \\n\\nGroup Risk Management uses the information reported to determine the current risk portfolio for the Merck \\nGroup, presenting this in a report to the Executive Board, the Supervisory Board, and relevant Committees with \\ndetailed explanations twice per year. This also encompasses a quantitative aggregation of risks at Group level, \\nusing a Monte Carlo simulation. Furthermore, significant changes in the assessment of the risks already known \\nand new significant risks can be reported at any time and are communicated to the Executive Board on an ad-\\nhoc basis. \\n\\nThe opportunity management process is integrated into our internal controlling processes and is carried out \\nbased on the Group strategy in the operating units. The business sectors analyze and assess potential market \\nopportunities as part of the strategy and planning processes. In this context, investment opportunities are \\nexamined and prioritized primarily in terms of their potential value proposition, to ensure an effective allocation \\nof resources. We target investment in growth markets to leverage the opportunities of dynamic development \\nand customer proximity at a local level. \\n\\nIf the occurrence of the identified opportunities is rated as likely, they are incorporated into the business plans \\nand forecasts. Trends going beyond this, or events that could lead to a positive development in the net assets, \\nfinancial position, and results of operations, are presented in the following report as opportunities. These could \\nhave a positive effect on our medium-term prospects. \\n\\nRisk and opportunity assessment \\n\\nThe significance of a risk is determined based on its probability to cause potential unfavorable deviations from \\nour financial and non-financial targets. \\n\\nThe underlying scales for measuring these factors are shown below: \\n\\nProbability of occurrence    \\n\\nProbability of occurrence \\n\\n Explanation \\n\\n< 1% \\n\\n1 – 5% \\n\\n5 – 20% \\n\\n20 – 50% \\n\\n> 50% \\n\\n Highly improbable \\n\\n Improbable \\n\\n Possible \\n\\n Likely \\n\\n More than likely \\n\\nDegree of impact \\n\\nDegree of impact \\n\\n  Explanation \\n\\n> € 500 million \\n\\n Critical negative impact on the net asset, financial position, and results of operations  \\n\\n€ 100 – 500 million \\n\\n Significant negative impact on the net asset, financial position, and results of operations  \\n\\n€ 25 – 100 million \\n\\n Moderate negative impact on the net asset, financial position, and results of operations  \\n\\n€ 10 – 25 million \\n\\n Minor negative impact on the net asset, financial position, and results of operations \\n\\n< € 10 million \\n\\n Immaterial negative impact on the net asset, financial position, and results of operations  \\n\\nFor non-financial risks (such as reputation, Environmental, Social, Governance (ESG)), we introduced a \\nqualitative rating scale as a reference for comprehensive assessment. The evaluation range is from low to \\ncritical. \\n\\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cCombined Management Report ___ Report on Risks and Opportunities \\n\\n87 \\n\\nOpportunities are assessed in their respective specific business environment. General measures of the business \\nfunctions are quantified during forecasting and strategic planning usually in relation to sales, EBITDA pre, and \\noperating cash flow. Net present value, internal rate of return, the return on capital employed (ROCE), and the \\npayback period of the investment are primarily used to assess and prioritize investment opportunities. We use \\nthese indicators to assess the opportunities arising from the investment projects. Similarly, scenarios are used \\nto simulate the influence of possible fluctuations and changes in the respective parameters on results. \\n\\nInternal control system for the (Group) accounting process \\n\\nThe objective of the internal control system for the accounting process is to implement controls that provide \\nassurance that the financial statements are prepared in compliance with the relevant accounting laws and \\nstandards. This system covers measures designed to ensure the complete, correct, and timely reporting and \\npresentation of information that is relevant for the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements and \\nthe Combined Management Report. \\n\\nOur internal control system for financial reporting is based on the COSO framework, a globally recognized \\nstandard divided into five components: control environment, risk assessment, control activities, information and \\ncommunication, as well as monitoring activities. Each of these components is regularly documented, tested \\nand/or assessed. \\n\\nThe internal control system aims to ensure the accuracy of the consolidated accounting process through \\nfunctioning internal controls with reasonable assurance. The Group Accounting function centrally steers the \\npreparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements of Merck KGaA as the parent company of the Merck \\nGroup. This Group function defines the reporting requirements that all Merck subsidiaries must meet. At the \\nsame time, this function steers and monitors the scheduling and process-related requirements of the \\nConsolidated Financial Statements. Group Accounting centrally manages all changes to the equity holding \\nstructure and correspondingly adapts the Group’s scope of consolidation. The proper elimination of intragroup \\ntransactions within the scope of the consolidation process is ensured. Group-wide accounting guidelines form \\nthe basis for the preparation of the statutory financial statements of the parent company and of the \\nsubsidiaries, which are reported to Group Accounting; the guidelines are adapted in a timely manner to reflect \\nchanges in the financial regulatory environment and are updated in accordance with internal reporting \\nrequirements. For special issues, such as the accounting treatment of intangible assets within the scope of \\ncompany acquisitions or pension obligations, external experts are additionally involved where necessary. \\n\\nThe individual companies have a local internal control system within a global framework. Where financial \\nprocesses are handled by a Shared Service Center, the internal control system of the Shared Service Center is \\nadditionally applied. Both ensure that accounting complies with IFRS (International Financial Reporting \\nStandards) and with the Group accounting guidelines. \\n\\nGroup Accounting provides support to the local contacts and ensures a consistently high quality of reporting \\nthroughout the entire reporting process. \\n\\nFor Group financial reporting purposes, most of our subsidiaries use standard SAP software. Consolidation \\nsoftware from SAP is also used for the elimination of intragroup transactions. A detailed authorization concept \\nensures the separation of duties with respect to both single-entity reporting and the Consolidated Financial \\nStatements. The accounting process is generally designed to ensure that all units involved adhere to the \\nprinciple of dual control. \\n\\nThe operational effectiveness of our internal control system is regularly tested in the format of self-assessments \\nby our legal entities, group functions, and shared services. The quality is systematically reviewed by a \\ndedicated global financial control and governance team. Control deficiencies are properly recorded and, \\nwherever necessary, adequate countermeasures are taken to remediate control deficiencies in a timely manner.  \\n\\n \\n\\x0cCombined Management Report ___ Report on Risks and Opportunities \\n\\n88 \\n\\nThe overall effectiveness of our internal control system with regard to accounting and compliance with financial \\nreporting on the part of the individual companies is confirmed by both the local Managing Director and the local \\nChief Financial Officer by signing the single-entity reporting and a separate confirmation regarding the \\neffectiveness of the financial control system (internal control system sign-off letter). For the accounting \\ntreatment of balance sheet items, Group Accounting closely cooperates with Group Risk Management to \\ncorrectly present potential risks in the balance sheet. \\n\\nAll structures and processes described above related to the Group Accounting procedures are subject to regular \\nreview by Group Internal Auditing based on an annual audit plan set out by the Executive Board.  \\n\\nThe results of the self-assessments, quality reviews, and internal audits are dealt with by the Executive Board, \\nthe Supervisory Board, and the Audit Committee. The internal control system at Merck makes it possible to \\nlower the risk of material misstatements in accounting to a minimum. However, residual risk cannot be entirely \\nruled out as no internal control system is infallible, irrespective of its design. \\n\\nThe Internal Control System of the Merck Group as the entirety of all controls shall avoid and reduce the \\nprobability of potential risks occurring as well as actively steer risks in business processes. Thereby, it \\ncontributes to ensure the compliance of the company’s activities with laws and regulations. The Internal Control \\nSystem in its entirety and the applied methods are continuously developed further. The responsibility for the \\neffectiveness of the Internal Control System and the further development of the non-financial key metrics lies \\nwith the respective responsible senior leaders/risk and process owners. \\n\\nBusiness-related risks and opportunities \\n\\nPolitical and regulatory risks and opportunities \\n\\nAs a global company, we face political and regulatory changes in a large number of countries and markets. \\n\\nRisk of more restrictive regulatory requirements regarding drug pricing and reimbursement \\n\\nIn the Healthcare business sector, the known trend towards increasingly restrictive requirements in terms of \\ndrug pricing, reimbursement, and the expansion of rebate groups is continuing. Specifically, in the United \\nStates, a pricing reform on prescription drugs is part of the agenda of the current administration. These \\nrequirements can negatively influence the profitability of our products, as can market referencing between \\ncountries, and the success of market launches. Foreseeable effects are considered as far as possible in the \\nbusiness sector’s plans. Close communication with health and regulatory authorities serves as a preventive \\nmeasure to avert such risks.\\u202f  \\n\\nRemaining risks beyond the current plans resulting from restrictive regulatory requirements are likely with a \\npotential moderate to significant impact. \\n\\nRisk of stricter regulations for the manufacturing, testing, and marketing of products \\n\\nWe must adhere to a multitude of regulatory requirements regarding the manufacturing, testing, and marketing \\nof many of our products. Specifically, in the European Union, we are subject to the EU chemicals regulation \\nREACH. Similar regulations are emerging globally in relevant markets, particularly in Asia. These regulations \\ndemand comprehensive tests for chemicals. Moreover, the use of chemicals in production and final products \\ncould be restricted, which would negatively impact the ability to manufacture and market certain products. With \\nthe EU Chemicals Strategy for Sustainability, an initiative of the European Green Deal, we expect increasing \\ndemands concerning the substitution of specific hazardous substances. We are constantly pursuing research \\nand development in substance characterization and the possible substitution of critical substances so as to \\nmitigate this risk. Nevertheless, it is classified as a possible risk with a potential significant impact on the net \\nassets, financial position, and results of operations. \\n\\n \\n\\x0cCombined Management Report ___ Report on Risks and Opportunities \\n\\n89 \\n\\nRisk of negative political and macroeconomic developments \\n\\nThe ongoing general trend of de-globalization and reshoring critical supplies might further increase the \\nestablishment of trade barriers. Additionally, the increased threat from armed conflicts and the rising tensions \\nbetween the United States and China could lead to further sanctions. These risks can have a negative impact on \\nour supply chains and sales in certain countries and regions. Such risks are considered as much as possible in \\nthe business plans of the affected countries and regions, and are mitigated through product, industry, and \\nregional diversification as well as measures to ensure resilience of supply chains and networks. In addition, \\nstrategic geopolitical risk management is in place at the Group and sector levels in order not to lose sight of the \\nglobal context and to prepare Merck holistically for possible risks. \\n\\nThe rise in inflation in the course of 2022 across some of our major markets could negatively impact our \\nbusiness. The current inflation dynamics are driven by a combination of supply disruptions, hefty fiscal \\nspending, and special factors. Persistently high inflation could increase our operating expenses (e.g., raw \\nmaterials, utilities, and logistics) as well as capital expenditures and lead to an increase in central bank rates, \\nwhich would affect our refinancing costs.\\u202f \\n\\nPotential negative macroeconomic developments can also impact our business. We see an increasing risk for a \\nglobal recession driven by current economic and political developments. In addition, the spread of the corona \\nvirus is associated with risks in global developments, likewise with the potential for negative effects on our \\nbusinesses. To minimize these impacts, corresponding measures have been initiated.  \\n\\nThe net risk of negative geo-political and macroeconomic developments is seen as possible and might have \\nsignificant to critical effects on the net assets, financial position, and results of operations. \\n\\nMarket risks and opportunities \\n\\nWe compete with numerous companies in the pharmaceutical, chemical, and life science sectors. Rising \\ncompetitive pressure can have a significant impact on the quantities that can be sold and prices attainable \\nfor our products. \\n\\nOpportunities presented by our fully integrated CDMO and Contract Testing Services   \\n\\nThe newly formed business unit, Life Science Services, fully integrates our Contract Development and \\nManufacturing Organization (CDMO) and contract testing services, strengthening our portfolio offerings \\nand value chain to better serve the evolving needs of our global customers. Our CDMO service business \\ncovers traditional modalities such as monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and high-potency active \\npharmaceutical ingredients (HP-APIs) and novel modalities such as antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) and \\nviral and gene therapies (VGTs). This also includes our mRNA offerings.  \\n\\nWe continually invest in the expansion of our portfolio and production capabilities to provide highly- \\nspecialized solutions for manufacturing traditional and novel therapies. For example, we strengthened our \\nviral vector manufacturing capabilities with the launch of the production platforms VirusExpress® Lentiviral \\nin 2020 and VirusExpress® 293 Adeno-Associated Virus (AAV) in 2022. This makes us one of the first \\nCDMOs and technology-developers to provide a full viral vector manufacturing offering. We are committed \\nto accelerating the manufacture of cell and gene therapies with the goal of getting these lifesaving \\ntreatments to patients faster. These proven, scalable platforms increase dose yields and reduce process \\ndevelopment times. More details on our capacity expansions are included in the following sections of this \\nreport. \\n\\nWe also expanded our manufacturing capabilities for HP-APIs and ADCs in the United States, positioning \\nus as one of the largest single-digit nanogram occupational exposure limit CDMO providers in the world. \\nThis will allow the continuous manufacturing of increasingly potent agents at an industrial scale for \\ntherapies with the potential to treat cancer. ADCs are an emerging class of medicines designed for the \\nhigh-specificity targeting and destruction of cancer cells, while preserving healthy cells. Only 13 ADCs are \\n\\n \\n\\x0cCombined Management Report ___ Report on Risks and Opportunities \\n\\n90 \\n\\ncurrently approved worldwide. The ADC industry is experiencing strong growth and is expected to reach \\n€ 13 billion market value by 2030. Additionally, we strengthened our CDMO services across the mRNA \\nvalue chain with the acquisition of Exelead in 2022. Exelead specializes in complex injectable formulations, \\nincluding Lipid Nanoparticle-based drug delivery technology, which is key in mRNA therapeutics for use in \\nmany other indications. We plan to invest more than € 500 million in the technology scale-up of Exelead \\nover the next ten years. This will further enable us to capture the significant potential of the fast-growing \\nmarket for mRNA therapies by providing leading CDMO services to our customers. \\n\\nOpportunities in Bioprocessing   \\n\\nIn Life Science, our bioprocessing business within the Process Solutions business sector is an important \\ngrowth driver. In 2022, we advanced our bioprocessing capabilities with the acquisition of the MAST® \\n(Modular Automated Sampling Technology) Platform. This leading automated, antiseptic bioreactor \\nsampling system provides real-time process information and cuts process development time by half, \\nimproving efficiency and lowering costs. This makes us the first company to offer a fully integrated \\necosystem for advanced process technologies. The technology, coupled with the software to analyze and \\nmanage data, allows us to offer unique and integrated solutions to help customers optimize their \\nbioprocesses and moves us closer toward our vision of connected and continuous bioprocessing to \\nincrease speed and lower costs. The MAST® Platform is part of Merck’s BioContinuum™ Platform. \\n\\nIn addition, we announced a collaboration with Agilent Technologies to fill an industry gap in Process \\nAnalytical Technologies (PAT) for downstream processing. By combining our advanced bioprocess portfolio \\nwith Agilent’s leading analytical solutions, we are able to offer integrated capabilities for enhanced \\ndownstream process monitoring and control, bringing us one step closer to making the facility of the \\nfuture a reality. Furthermore, in December 2022, we announced the acquisition of Massachusetts-based \\nErbi Biosystems, a developer of the two milliliter (mL) micro-bioreactor platform technology known as the \\nBreez™. The deal strengthens our upstream portfolio in therapeutic proteins by enabling scalable cell-\\nbased perfusion bioreactor processes from 2 ml to 2,000 L with rapid lab-scale process development. At \\nthe same time it also offers future development opportunities in novel modality applications. \\n\\nOpportunities from leveraging the e-commerce and distribution platform  \\n\\nIn the Life Science business sector, our dedication to the customer experience extends from the lab to our \\nprimary e-commerce platform, sigmaaldrich.com, which connects scientists in nearly every country around the \\nworld with the products, publications, and technical expertise needed to advance their discovery, research, and \\ndevelopment further and faster. Our efforts include innovative approaches across the globe, bolstering \\nsigmaaldrich.com and our e-commerce expertise to continually improve the customer experience and leverage \\nthe platform as a scalable growth driver for the business. \\n\\nOpportunities in the semiconductor industry \\n\\nWe have huge long-term growth opportunities in the semiconductor market due to the significantly accelerating \\nglobal demand for innovative semiconductor materials. This demand is driven by exponential data growth and \\nhighly impactful technology trends such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and 5G. We are working on nearly all of \\nthese new technology inflection points of the semiconductor roadmap together with our customers. Our \\ncapacity investments are synchronized with our customers’ expansion plans, and we continue to tackle industry \\nchallenges as well as supply reliability. Our semiconductor business has a very broad and unique portfolio that \\nis not dependent on a single product or technology. It consists of different, independent technologies: Thin \\nFilm, Patterning, Planarization, as well as Specialty Gases and Delivery System & Services (DS&S). With this \\nportfolio, we supply products for all essential production steps of wafer processing to support our customers \\nwith their advanced needs integral to realizing next-generation chips: patterning, deposition, planarization, \\netching, cleaning, doping and packaging. Moreover, we are developing new dielectric platforms in cooperation \\nwith our key customers for 3D NAND applications. We also continue to see significant potential in our DS&S \\nbusiness to provide our largest customers with turnkey solutions for the delivery of bulk gases in the \\n\\n \\n\\x0cCombined Management Report ___ Report on Risks and Opportunities \\n\\n91 \\n\\nmanufacturing process. As the electronics industry continues to announce major capacity expansions over the \\nnext few years, our DS&S business is well poised to benefit from this with their portfolio of gas and chemical \\ncabinets. \\n\\nOpportunities due to new technologies in the manufacturing of displays \\n\\nWe see opportunities in market growth of organic light-emitting diode (OLED) materials in high-quality display \\napplications. We have been performing research and development in the area of OLED technology for more \\nthan 15 years and have become one of the leading material suppliers for OLEDs. Through our semiconductor \\nand display knowledge, we will be able to contribute to the new generation of optimized sensors. Furthermore, \\nwe see opportunities in foldable displays, which require a broad set of materials ranging from encapsulation to \\nthe OLED stack. \\n\\nRisks due to increased competition and customer technology changes  \\n\\nIn the Healthcare business sector, both our biopharmaceutical products and classic pharmaceutical business are \\nexposed to increased competition from other rival products (in the form of biosimilars and generics). In the \\nLife Science and Electronics business sectors, risks are posed by not only cyclical business fluctuations but also \\nchanges in the technologies used or customer sourcing strategies. We use close customer relationships and in-\\nhouse further developments as well as market proximity, including precise market analyses, as mitigating \\nmeasures. Overall, the risks might have potential significant to critical impact. \\n\\nRisks and opportunities of research and development  \\n\\nInnovation driven by research and development is a major element of the Group strategy, in particular in the \\nHealthcare business sector. In regular portfolio management reviews, we continually evaluate and, if necessary, \\nrealign research areas and R&D pipeline projects to focus our investments in areas where patient needs are \\nserved best. Nevertheless, research and development projects can experience delays, expected budgets can be \\nexceeded, or targets can remain unmet. In addition to inhouse research and development efforts, strategic \\nalliances with external partners and the in- or out-licensing of programs also form part of the catalog of \\nmeasures to develop innovative medicine and ensure the efficient allocation of resources.  \\n\\nIn Healthcare, we are committed to drive the launches of Bavencio®, Tepmetko® and Mavenclad®. Bavencio® is \\na human anti-programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) antibody jointly developed under the strategic alliance \\nconcluded with Pfizer Inc. in 2014. It is currently approved for at least one indication for patients in more than \\n50 countries and targets different kinds and stages of carcinoma. Additional applications for Bavencio® have \\nbeen submitted to regulatory authorities worldwide. Tepmetko® is a once-daily oral mesenchymal-epithelial \\ntransition (MET) inhibitor that inhibits the oncogenic MET receptor signaling caused by MET (gene) alterations. \\nDiscovered and developed in-house at Merck, Tepmetko® has a highly selective mechanism of action, with the \\npotential to improve outcomes in aggressive tumors that have a poor prognosis and harbor these specific \\nalterations. Tepmetko® (tepotinib) is available in a number of countries and under review by various other \\nregulatory authorities globally. We are further investigating the potential role of tepotinib in treating patients \\nwith NSCLC and acquired resistance due to MET amplification in the Phase II INSIGHT 2 study. Mavenclad® \\n(cladribine tablets) was approved by the European Commission in 2017 and is the first short-course oral \\ntreatment approved in Europe for the treatment of relapsing multiple sclerosis (RMS) in patients with high \\ndisease activity. It is now approved in more than 80 countries. New real-world data from the MSBase Registry \\ndemonstrate favorable efficacy outcomes for Mavenclad® versus other oral disease modifying therapies (DMTs) \\nand lower occurrence of further relapses or disability progression. \\n\\nIn addition to marketing already approved medicines, we are pushing ahead with research projects in important \\ntherapeutic areas. We target the set-up of a new standard of care in squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck \\n(LA SCCHN) through our potent oral inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPi) antagonist xevinapant, which is \\ncurrently being investigated in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III clinical trials: the \\nTrilynX study for patients with unresected LA SCCHN and the XRay Vision study for patients with resected LA \\nSCCHN. Xevinapant is the only medicine in its class in late-stage clinical development and has the potential to \\n\\n \\n\\x0cCombined Management Report ___ Report on Risks and Opportunities \\n\\n92 \\n\\nbe first-in-class. We have a worldwide in-licensing agreement with Debiopharm, Lausanne, Switzerland, for the \\ndevelopment and commercialization of xevinapant. Furthermore, the development of our Bruton’s tyrosine \\nkinase inhibitor (BTKi) evobrutinib with first-in-class potential in relapsing multiple sclerosis (RMS) is further \\nprogressing in the Phase III Evolution RMS clinical trial program. Evobrutinib is an oral, highly selective BTKi \\noffering a novel dual mechanism of action that could address MS pathobiology in a fundamentally new way.   \\n\\nSustainable long-term growth will be driven by new pipeline entrants in DNA damage biology, novel ADC and \\nenpatoran (TLR 7/8) that underline an exciting and less risk-correlated approach in oncology and \\nneuroinflammation. With enpatoran and M1231, a MUC1/EGFR bi-specific ADC, we have two additional assets in \\nour portfolio with first-in-class potential. Enpatoran is a small molecule for targeted inhibition of the important \\nlupus mediator TLR7/8, aiming for improved efficacy with low infection risk. For enpatoran, we are currently in \\na Phase II study in CLE (cutaneous lupus erythematosus) and SLE (systemic lupus erythematosus). M1231 is \\nconsidered as next generation ADC for patients with solid tumors aiming for effective delivery of potent \\nchemotherapy payload with reduced on- and off-target toxicity. In September 2022, we announced a \\ncollaboration agreement with licensing option with Nerviano Medical Sciences S.r.l. (NMS) for the next-\\ngeneration highly selective and brain-penetrant PARP1 (poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase) inhibitor, NMS-293. \\nNMS-293 is in early clinical development for the treatment of patients with breast cancer (BRCA)-mutated \\ntumors as a single agent and in combination with temozolomide in recurrent glioblastoma. It has strong \\npotential in combination with a wide variety of DNA-damaging agents, including systemic or targeted \\nchemotherapy (ADCs) or with DNA damage response inhibitors, in numerous tumor types. In December 2022, \\nwe announced a research collaboration and commercial license agreement with Mersana Therapeutics, Inc to \\ndevelop novel immunostimulatory ADC. The collaboration is focused on discovering novel STING-agonist ADCs \\nfor up to two targets leveraging Mersana’s proprietary Immunosynthen platform to conjugate proprietary \\nantibodies from our company. The STING pathway is a fundamental means of generating innate immune \\nresponse that can lead to anti-tumor activity and immunological memory. \\n\\nSometimes, development projects are discontinued after high levels of investment at a late phase of clinical \\ndevelopment. Decisions – such as those relating to the transition to the next clinical phase – are taken with a \\nview to minimizing risk. We are currently not aware of any risks beyond general development risks that could \\nsignificantly affect the net assets, financial position, and results of operations. There is the risk that regulatory \\nauthorities either do not grant or delay approval or grant only restricted approval. The risk that undesirable side \\neffects of a pharmaceutical product could remain undetected until after approval or registration could result in a \\nrestriction of approval or withdrawal from the market. Well-advanced programs in our pipeline and those of our \\npartners result in potential new approvals. Missing targets in this area may have significant to critical effects on \\nour financial position and operating result, for example due to lower net sales or the non-occurrence of \\nmilestone payments from collaboration agreements. These risks are evaluated with probabilities ranging from \\nimprobable to likely. \\n\\nFor more detailed description on our R&D activities worldwide, please refer to the section “Research and \\nDevelopment” in “Fundamental Information about the Group” in the annual report. \\n\\nOpportunities presented by activities to boost innovative strength \\n\\nWe see the rise of bioconvergence, which we define as a multidisciplinary approach that harnesses the \\nsynergies across digital and material science, as well as biotechnology. It will improve the speed and impact of \\nscientific discovery. Fostering innovation at the intersection of our business sectors will allow us to benefit from \\nour unique positioning at the sweet spot of converging technologies, unlocking organic growth opportunities \\nand enabling pioneering solutions for customers and patients. Examples of innovation at the intersection of our \\nbusiness sectors include an automated design-make-test-analyze platform powered with state-of-the-art AI and \\nlab automation, new treatment possibilities via enhanced mRNA LNP delivery platforms, and the deployment of \\ndigital twins in smart manufacturing. \\n\\nDigital technologies and data will enable the development of personalized solutions of the future, accelerate our \\nR&D pipelines, and ultimately improve patient and customer outcomes. In this context, developing and \\n\\n \\n\\x0cCombined Management Report ___ Report on Risks and Opportunities \\n\\n93 \\n\\nadhering to rigorous ethical standards is of utmost importance for all our activities. Therefore, we created the \\nMerck Digital Ethics Advisory Panel to provide external guidance and expertise on complex ethical matters \\naround data usage, algorithms, and new digital innovations, ensuring that the company develops new digital \\ntechnologies responsibly. In addition, we established the Code of Digital Ethics, which serves as a basis for \\nethical risk assessment in existing ventures as well as the design of ethic checkpoints for nascent digital \\nsolutions throughout the company. \\n\\nRisks and opportunities related to the quality and availability of products \\n\\nOpportunities arising from capacity expansion \\n\\nWe make targeted investments worldwide to expand our regional capacities and drive sustainable growth in all \\nour three business sectors, especially in the “Big 3” growth drivers of Merck: Process Solutions and \\nLife Science Services in Life Science, new innovative Healthcare products, and Semiconductor Solutions in \\nElectronics.  \\n\\nIn Life Science, we opened a new commercial facility in Martillac, France, to expand our production capacity for \\nmAbs and other recombinant proteins as part our global Millipore® Contract Testing, Development, and \\nManufacturing Organization (CTDMO) Services. Leveraging state-of-the-art technology and a proven quality \\nsystem allows our clients to streamline and accelerate the commercialization process by eliminating the need \\nfor tech transfer and scale-up between clinical and commercial stages. Our Millipore® CTDMO Services network \\nincludes facilities throughout Europe, the United States and Asia covering pre-clinical to commercial phases, \\nincluding testing. Investments into our global network also include the recently announced € 290 million \\ninvestment in a new facility to support the increasing demand for biosafety testing and analytical development \\nservices at our site in Rockland, Maryland, USA. This is the largest testing investment in company history. \\n\\nIn addition, we opened a € 59 million facility in Verona, Wisconsin, USA, which positions us as one of the leading, \\nglobal CDMOs of HP-APIs used in novel cancer therapies, including ADCs. We also opened a viral clearance lab as \\npart of the first building phase of our new € 29 million biologics testing center in Shanghai, China. \\n\\nWe further invested more than € 230 million to strengthen our manufacturing capabilities for single-use \\nassemblies critical to the manufacture of Covid-19 vaccines and other life-saving therapies at our sites in \\nMolsheim, France, and Wuxi, China. In addition, we invested € 440 million in the production capacity expansion \\nfor single-use membranes and filtration at our site in Cork, Ireland. We also started construction of a lateral \\nflow membrane production facility at our U.S. site in Sheboygan, Wisconsin, USA, supported by a € 121 million \\ncontract award from the U.S. Department of Defense, on behalf of the U.S. Department of Health and Human \\nServices. Lateral flow membranes are a key component in rapid diagnostic test kits for a variety of applications, \\nincluding Covid-19 testing. \\n\\nIn Electronics, we plan to invest nearly € 3 billion in innovation and capacities up to the end of 2025. We will \\ncontinue to heavily invest in research and development (R&D) in leading-edge material solutions and plan to \\nspend close to € 2 billion in long-term fixed assets (capital expenditures). Through our Level Up growth \\nprogram, we aim to capture the growth opportunities that come along with the significantly accelerating global \\ndemand for innovative semiconductor and display materials and invest in smart localization of our footprint to \\nfurther boost customer proximity and ensure supply stability. Furthermore, we recently completed the \\nacquisition of the chemicals business of Mecaro, a Korean supplier to the semiconductor industry to expand our \\nportfolio in the fast-growing Semiconductor Solutions business unit. Among other things, we will further \\nleverage our data analytics capabilities and invest even further into the safety realm. \\n\\nRisk of a temporary ban on products/production facilities or of non-registration of products due to \\nnon-compliance with quality standards \\n\\nWe are required to comply with the highest standards of quality in the manufacturing of pharmaceutical \\nproducts (Good Manufacturing Practice or official pharmacopoeia). In this regard, we are subject to the \\nsupervision of the regulatory authorities. Conditions imposed by national regulatory authorities could result in a \\n\\n \\n\\x0cCombined Management Report ___ Report on Risks and Opportunities \\n\\n94 \\n\\ntemporary ban on products/production facilities and possibly affect new registrations with the respective \\nauthority. We make the utmost effort to ensure compliance with regulations, regularly perform our own internal \\naudits, and carry out external inspections. Thanks to these quality assurance processes, the occurrence of a \\nrisk with a significant impact is improbable to possible; however, it cannot be entirely ruled out. Depending on \\nthe product concerned and the severity of the objection, such a risk might have a negative impact on the net \\nassets, financial position, and results of operations. \\n\\nRisks of production availability \\n\\nFurther risks include operational failures due to fire or force majeure, for example natural disasters such as \\nfloods, droughts, or earthquakes, which could lead to a substantial interruption or restriction of business \\nactivities. Insofar as it is possible and economically viable, the Group limits its damage risks with insurance \\ncoverage, the nature and extent of which is constantly adapted to current requirements. Likewise, we are \\nexposed to risks of production outages and the related supply bottlenecks that can be triggered by technical \\nproblems in production facilities with very high-capacity utilization. Furthermore, there are risks of supply \\nbottlenecks due to a lack or disappearance of capacity. We work towards continual mitigation of such risks by \\nmaking regular investments, setting up alternative sourcing options, and maintaining inventory levels.\\u202f  \\n\\nAlthough the occurrence of these risks is considered – improbable, an individual event could have a critical \\nnegative effect on the net assets, financial position, and results of operations.  \\n\\nRisks of dependency on suppliers  \\n\\nIn balanced markets, single-sourcing strategies may be chosen to bundle our company’s demand and achieve \\nprice reductions. However, this strategy might result in dependency on individual suppliers for a number of \\ngoods or services. Consequently, events like discontinued/curtailed production or supply disruptions could \\npotentially result in unavailability of such goods or services and have a critical impact on the concerned \\nbusinesses. The Covid-19 pandemic represented an additional force, highlighting the potential risks of the \\nsingle-source strategies. The past few years an increasing number of events, from the Covid-19 pandemic to \\nthe war in Ukraine, have shaped the risks and opportunities around single source strategies. With long-term \\nstrategic alliances, qualification and validation of alternative sources, as well as second supplier development \\nstrategies, we are able to reduce the probability of occurrence of these risks and rate them as possible. \\n\\nRisks due to product-related crime \\n\\nAs a leading global science and technology company and manufacturer of innovative products of the highest \\nquality, we are exposed to various security- and crime-related risks. Due to the increasing complexity of \\ninternational trade and global supply chains, our products are particularly at risk from being counterfeited, \\nstolen, illegally diverted and misused. If left unaddressed, this would not only lead to financial loss, reputational \\ndamage, and business disruption but also impact patient and customer safety. Consequently, we have \\nimplemented technical, operational, and procedural measures aimed at protecting the integrity of our products \\nand supply chains, while also ensuring new threats are identified and managed appropriately. Overall, the \\nthreat resulting from product-related crime is likely with a potential moderate impact.  \\n\\nRisks and opportunities from the use of social media \\n\\nWe and our employees are active on numerous social media platforms. The consistent and legally compliant use \\nof such platforms and their content is important in terms of increasing awareness of our brand, among other \\nthings. We take all necessary precautions and have implemented processes to ensure awareness regarding the \\nproper handling of social media as well as actively manage and control our publication and communication.  \\n\\nNevertheless, reputational risks could result, for instance through public dialogues in social media. We thus rate \\nthis as a potentially significant risk.\\u202f\\n\\n \\n\\x0cCombined Management Report ___ Report on Risks and Opportunities \\n\\n95 \\n\\nFinancial risks and opportunities \\n\\nAs we operate internationally, and due to our presence in the capital markets, we are exposed to various \\nfinancial risks and opportunities. Above all, these are liquidity and counterparty risks, financial market risks and \\nopportunities, and risks of fluctuations in the market values of operational tangible and intangible assets, as \\nwell as risks and opportunities from pension obligations. \\n\\nIn the area of financial risks and opportunities, we use an active management strategy to reduce the effects of \\nfluctuations in exchange and interest rates. The management of financial risks and opportunities by using \\nderivatives is regulated through extensive guidelines. Speculation is prohibited, and derivative transactions are \\nsubject to constant risk controls. The strict separation of functions between trading, settlement, and control \\nfunctions is ensured. \\n\\nLiquidity risks \\n\\nTo ensure continued existence, we must be able to fulfill our commitments arising from operating and financial \\nactivities at any time. Therefore, to reduce potential liquidity risks, we have a central Group-wide liquidity \\nmanagement system in place, and a balanced maturity profile. The maturities of our financial liabilities are aligned \\nwith our planned free cash flow. Furthermore, we have a syndicated loan facility of € 2.5 billion with a term until \\n2027, which ensures continuing solvency if any liquidity bottlenecks occur. As our loan agreements do not contain \\nany financial covenants, these agreed lines of credit can be accessed even if Merck’s credit rating should \\ndeteriorate. Additionally, we have a commercial paper program with a maximum volume of € 2 billion. \\n\\nCounterparty risks \\n\\nCounterparty risks arise from the potential default by a partner in connection with financial investments, loans, \\nand financing commitments on the one hand and receivables in operating business on the other. \\n\\nAs for counterparty risks from financial transactions, we review all central positions relating to trading partners \\nand their credit ratings daily. We manage financial risks of default by diversifying our financial positions and \\nthrough the related active management of our trading partners. Significant financial transactions involving \\ncredit risk are entered into with banks and industrial companies that have a good credit rating. Moreover, our \\nlarge banking syndicate – the renewed syndicated loan facility of € 2.5 billion was syndicated among 15 banks \\nin 2022 – reduces possible losses in the event of default. \\n\\nThe solvency and operational development of trading partners are regularly reviewed as part of the \\nmanagement of operational counterparty risks. Sovereign risks are also analyzed. The volume of receivables of \\neach customer is capped in line with their credit ratings. Risk-mitigating measures, such as credit insurance, \\nare utilized as appropriate. Nevertheless, defaults by isolated trading partners, even those with outstanding \\ncredit ratings, cannot be entirely ruled out, although rated as unlikely (further information can be found in \\n“Credit risks” in the note “Management of financial risks” in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial \\nStatements). \\n\\nCounterparty risk is classified as a possible risk with a moderate effect. \\n\\nFinancial market risks and opportunities \\n\\nAs a result of our international business activities and global corporate structure, we are exposed to risks and \\nopportunities from fluctuations in exchange rates. These result from financial transactions, operating \\nreceivables, and liabilities, as well as future cash flows from sales and costs in foreign currency. We use \\nderivatives to manage and reduce these risks and opportunities (further information can be found in the note \\n“Derivative financial instruments” in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Foreign exchange \\nrate risks are rated as possible with a potential substantial effect on the net assets, financial position, and \\nresults of operations. \\n\\n \\n\\x0cCombined Management Report ___ Report on Risks and Opportunities \\n\\n96 \\n\\nVariable interest and current financial liabilities are exposed to the risks and opportunities of interest rate \\nfluctuations. These are also managed and reduced using derivatives. Interest rate risks have a potentially \\nnegative impact, are considered possible, and pose an immaterial risk overall. \\n\\nRisks of impairment of balance sheet items \\n\\nThe carrying amounts of individual balance sheet items are subject to the risk of changing market and business \\nconditions and thus to changes in fair values as well. Necessary impairments could have a significant negative \\nnon-cash impact on earnings and affect the accounting ratios. This applies specifically to the high level of \\nintangible assets including goodwill, which mainly derive from the purchase price allocations made in connection \\nwith past acquisitions (further information can be found in the notes “Goodwill” and “Other intangible assets” in \\nthe Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements). All relevant risks were assessed during the preparation of \\nthe Consolidated Financial Statements and were taken into consideration accordingly. We rate risks beyond this \\nas improbable with a potential critical impact.\\u202f  \\n\\nRisks and opportunities from pension obligations \\n\\nWe have commitments in connection with pension obligations. The present value of defined benefit obligations \\ncan be significantly increased or reduced by changes in the relevant valuation parameters, for example the \\ninterest rate or future salary increases. Pension obligations are regularly assessed as part of annual actuarial \\nreports. The obligations are covered by the pension provisions reported in the balance sheet based on the \\nassumptions as of the balance sheet date. Some of these obligations are funded by plan assets (further \\ninformation can be found in the note “Provisions for pensions and other post-employment benefits” in the Notes \\nto the Consolidated Financial Statements). To the extent that pension obligations are covered by plan assets \\nconsisting of interest-bearing securities, shares, real estate, and other financial assets, decreasing or negative \\nreturns on these assets can adversely affect the fair value of plan assets and thus result in further additions to \\npension provisions. By contrast, rising returns increase the value of plan assets, thereby resulting in excess \\ncover of plan liabilities. We increase the opportunities of fluctuations in the market value of plan assets on the \\none hand and reduce the risks on the other by using a diversified investment strategy. The possible risk due to \\npension obligations could have moderate effects on the net assets, financial position, and results of operations. \\n\\nAssessment by independent rating agencies \\n\\nThe capital market uses the assessments published by rating agencies to help lenders assess the risks of a \\nfinancial instrument used by Merck. We are currently rated by Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s, and Scope. \\nStandard & Poor’s has issued a long-term credit rating of A with a stable outlook, Moody’s a rating of A3 with a \\nstable outlook, and Scope a rating of A with a stable outlook. In line with market procedures, our financing \\nconditions are closely tied to our rating. The better the rating, the more favorably we can generally raise funds \\non the capital market or from banks. \\n\\nOverview of Rating Development \\n\\n \\n \\n\\x0cCombined Management Report ___ Report on Risks and Opportunities \\n\\n97 \\n\\nRisks due to the divestment, acquisition, and integration of companies and businesses \\n\\nSuccessfully acquiring and subsequently integrating new businesses entails risks. These are primarily centered \\naround the uncertainty of reaching business targets and synergy goals, as well as staying within the planned \\nintegration budget. Divestments, on the other hand, could lead to liabilities and additional expenses related to \\npotential indemnifications and commitments guaranteed in the sale transaction. We leverage our solid \\nacquisition track record to reduce the probability of any transaction-associated risks, by integrating lessons \\nlearned from past transactions, strong due diligence, and closely managed integration processes. Given the \\ncurrent situation, there are no major risks.\\u202f \\n\\nTax risks \\n\\nMerck and its subsidiaries operate worldwide and are consequently subject to different national tax laws and \\nregulations. National tax audits of our entities are conducted on an ongoing basis by the tax authorities of the \\nrespective countries in which we operate. Tax risks originate particularly from the changes in national tax laws \\nand regulations, and case laws and interpretations by national tax authorities, as well as from significant \\ntransactions such as acquisitions, divestments and reorganizations.  \\n\\nFindings of the national audit authorities of the various countries may lead to higher tax expenses and \\npayments and may also have an impact on the amount of tax receivables, and tax liabilities as well as on \\ndeferred tax assets and liabilities.  \\n\\nThe tax function at Merck regularly and systematically assesses the relevant tax risks. Appropriate standards \\nare put in place to identify tax risks at an early stage in order to review, assess and mitigate them effectively \\nand efficiently. Mitigation measures are coordinated by the tax department with the subsidiaries. Risks in \\naddition to those already considered in the balance sheet are classified as improbable to possible with potential \\nmoderate to substantial impact on the net asset, financial position, and results of operations. \\n\\nFor information on the accounting and measurement policies for income taxes, please refer to the section \\n“Income tax” in “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements” in the annual report.\\n\\nLegal risks \\n\\nGenerally, we strive to minimize and control our legal risks. To this end, we have taken the necessary \\nprecautions to identify threats and defend our rights where necessary. \\n\\nNevertheless, we are still exposed to risks from litigations or legal proceedings. In particular, these include risks \\nin the areas of product liability, competition and antitrust law, pharmaceutical law, patent law, trademark law, \\ndata protection law, tax law, and environmental protection. As a research-based company, we have a valuable \\nportfolio of industrial property rights, patents, and brands that could become the target of attacks and \\ninfringements. The outcome of future proceedings or those currently pending is difficult to foresee.  \\n\\nFor instance, we are currently involved in litigation with Merck & Co. Inc., Kenilworth, NJ, United States \\n(outside the United States and Canada: Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp. (MSD)), against whom we have filed \\nlawsuits in various countries. This company has also sued us in the United States for trademark infringement, \\namong other things.  \\n\\nDue to long statutes of limitations or in some cases the absence thereof, it is not possible to rule out that we will \\nface third-party claims arising from the same issue despite the conclusion of legal proceedings. Court or official \\nrulings or settlements can lead to expenses with a substantial to critical impact on our business and earnings.  \\n\\nDespite extensive precautionary measures, non-compliance with laws and regulations leading to related \\nconsequences can never be completely excluded.  \\n\\nIn our opinion, the lawsuits described below constitute the most significant legal risks. This should not be seen \\nas an exhaustive list of all legal disputes currently ongoing.  \\n\\n \\n\\x0cCombined Management Report ___ Report on Risks and Opportunities \\n\\n98 \\n\\nRisks due to antitrust and other government proceedings \\n\\nRaptiva®: In December 2011, the federal state of São Paulo, Brazil, sued Merck for damages because of alleged \\ncollusion between various pharmaceutical companies and an association of patients suffering from psoriasis and \\nvitiligo. This collusion is alleged to have been intended to increase sales of the medicines from the companies \\ninvolved to the detriment of patients and state coffers. Moreover, patients are also suing for damages in \\nconnection with the product Raptiva®. Merck has taken appropriate accounting measures for these issues, \\nwhich relate to various legal cases. Risks in excess of this with a negative effect on the net assets, financial \\nposition, and results of operations cannot be ruled out, but are considered possible with minor impact.  \\n\\nRisks in connection with a settlement agreement concluded by the divested Generics \\ngroup \\n\\nParoxetine: In the United Kingdom, Merck was subject to antitrust investigations by the British Competition and \\nMarket Authority in connection with the generics business that was divested in 2007. In March 2013, the \\nauthorities informed Merck of the assumption that a settlement agreement entered into in 2002 between \\nGenerics (UK) Ltd., United Kingdom, and several subsidiaries of GlaxoSmithKline plc, United Kingdom, in \\nconnection with the antidepressant drug paroxetine, violated British and European competition law and set a \\nfine. They stated that Merck was liable as the then owner of Generics (UK) Ltd. and because it was involved in \\nthe negotiations for the settlement agreement. The investigations into Generics (UK) Ltd. started in 2011, \\nwithout this being known to Merck. After the European Court of Justice confirmed in January 2020 that such \\nsettlement agreements can violate European competition law, the Competition Appeal Tribunal confirmed in \\nMay 2021 the low single-digit million euro fine that Merck paid in September 2021. British National Health \\nServices subsequently asserted claims for damages on account of the anti-competitive settlement agreements \\nin 2002. Merck and the National Health Service for England and Wales agreed on a settlement payment in \\nDecember 2022. The payment was made in January 2023. The previous provision in a low double-digit million \\neuro amount was reversed almost in full. Citalopram: In connection with the generics business that was \\ndivested in 2007, Merck was accused of breaching EU antitrust law through agreements entered into by its \\nformer subsidiary Generics (UK) Ltd., United Kingdom, relating to the antidepressant Citalopram patented by \\nLundbeck A/S, Denmark. The European Commission imposed a fine in June 2013. Merck filed a lawsuit against \\nthe Commission’s decision with the European Court (EC) in August 2013. The lawsuit was rejected in 2016. \\nMerck subsequently filed an appeal against this decision with the European Court of Justice, which confirmed \\nthe first instance ruling in March 2021. Although the fine of € 18 million was paid in 2013, additional potential \\nclaims were considered to be probable. A provision in a mid-double-digit million euro amount was recognized \\nfor these proceedings as of December 31, 2022. A cash outflow within the next twelve months is considered \\npossible. \\n\\nProduct liability risks \\n\\nOperating in the chemical and pharmaceutical industry, we are particularly exposed to product liability risks. \\nProduct liability risks can lead to considerable claims for damages, costs to avert damages, and potentially loss \\nof reputation. Considering this, we have taken out the liability insurance that is a standard within our industry \\nto mitigate such risks. However, it could be that the insurance coverage available is insufficient for individual \\ncases. Although the occurrence of product liability claims in excess of the existing insurance coverage is \\nconsidered highly improbable, individual cases could still have a critical effect on the net assets, financial \\nposition, and results of operations. \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cCombined Management Report ___ Report on Risks and Opportunities \\n\\n99 \\n\\nHuman resources risks \\n\\nOur future growth is highly dependent on our strength to innovate. Therefore, the expertise and engagement of \\nemployees in all sectors in which we operate are crucial to our success. The markets relevant to the company \\nare characterized by intense competition to recruit qualified specialists and talents, and by the challenge of \\nbeing perceived by the public as an attractive employer. Fluctuation risks specific to countries and industries \\nhave to be identified ahead of time and specifically addressed in order to keep the skills and expertise critical to \\nsuccess and business within the company.\\u202f  \\n\\nRecruiting and retaining specialists and talents are therefore key priorities for the company and are managed \\nthrough the targeted use of, for instance, employer branding initiatives, global talent, and succession \\nmanagement processes, as well as competitive compensation packages. Nevertheless, employee-related risks \\nthat affect business activities are possible; even though their impact is difficult to assess we evaluated a \\npotential impact on the qualitative rating scale as significant. \\n\\nInformation technology risks \\n\\nWe use a variety of IT systems and processes to optimally support our globalization. Trends in information \\ntechnology offer various opportunities but also harbor risks.  \\n\\nRisks due to cybercrime and the failure of business-critical applications \\n\\nIncreasing international networking and the related possibility of IT system abuse are resulting in cybercrime \\nrisks for Merck, such as the failure of central IT systems, the loss of the data integrity or the disclosure of \\nconfidential data from research and business activities, the manipulation of IT systems in process control, or an \\nincreased burden or adverse impact on IT systems as a result of virus attacks.  \\n\\nThe Merck Group maintains and operates an information protection management system based on ISO 27001. \\nOur governance framework contains organizational, process-related, and technical information security \\ncountermeasures based on recognized international standards. In addition, we\\u202femploy\\u202fharmonized electronic \\nand physical security controls\\u202f(e.g., access control and security monitoring) to bolster our ability to handle \\nsensitive data, such as trade secrets.  \\n\\nCyber Security is part of our Group Corporate Security Office. In addition, we have a Group Chief Information \\nSecurity Officer and a network of Information Security Officers within the business sectors, each supported by \\ndedicated networks. The individual sectors hold risk ownership and act as our first line of cyber security \\ndefense. Our Global Cyber Security function acts as a second line of defense and has responsibilities regarding \\ncyber security risk governance and oversight. Our third line of defense consists of internal audits.  \\n\\nGlobally used IT applications form the basis for the contractual delivery of products and solutions. The failure of \\nbusiness-critical IT applications could therefore have a direct influence on our ability to deliver and on the \\nquality of our products. This also applies to the failure of a data center. To achieve the required service quality, \\nwe use a quality management system certified to ISO 9001 that also applies to the provision of IT. In addition, \\nto reduce the risk of failure, we operate several redundantly designed data centers. Furthermore, insurance \\nsolutions for cybercrime offenses are in place at Group level.  \\n\\nLikewise, complications with the changeover of IT systems could negatively impact the earnings situation. Close \\nmonitoring of critical IT projects serves to mitigate this risk.  \\n\\nDespite the mitigation measures applied and functional continuity plans, the effects of cybercrime or the failure \\nof business-critical IT applications and their influence on the net assets, financial position, and results of \\noperations are considered to be possible and with potentially significant impact.  \\n\\n \\n\\x0cCombined Management Report ___ Report on Risks and Opportunities \\n\\n100 \\n\\nEnvironmental, climate-related, and safety risks and opportunities \\n\\nRisks arising from environment, and climate as well as plant and equipment \\n\\nAs a company with global production operations, we are exposed to risks of possible damage to personnel, \\ngoods, and our reputation. Those include physical risks stemming from exposure to droughts, storms, and \\nfloods. Mitigation measures like audits, consultations, and trainings on environmental protection, occupational \\nhealth and safety minimize these risks to people as well as the environment. In order to ensure the continuity \\nof plant and equipment, we monitor these risks both at our own sites as well as at suppliers and contract \\nmanufacturers. By adhering to high technical standards, our rules of conduct, and all legal requirements in \\nenvironmental protection, and occupational health and safety, we ensure the preservation of goods and assets. \\nWe have taken sufficient appropriate accounting measures for the environmental risks known to us. We monitor \\nregulatory risks in connection with the transition to a low-carbon economy, which could materialize in the mid- \\nand long-term through rising carbon prices through emissions trading systems, taxes or energy legislation. We \\nmitigate those risks with our energy and carbon management measures. We classify these as possible risks \\nbased on which a significant impact on the financial position cannot be ruled out. \\n\\nOpportunities arising from the further integration of sustainability in the corporate strategy \\n\\nIn 2020, we integrated sustainability more strongly in the corporate strategy, setting three goals in the areas of \\nscience and technology, value chain, and climate and environment. By considering the goals of the \\nsustainability strategy when making business decisions and actively shifting our portfolio to increase the \\npositive sustainability impact, we contribute to achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. In \\n2022, we extended the targeted strategies for our business sectors. Also, we launched a sustainability \\nscorecard for our research and development activities. Our dedication to sustainability paired with our \\ncommitment to quality, regulatory excellence, and compliance is important for us. Combining these strategic \\nelements will ensure an effective and efficient execution of our strategy and enable us to cater to the increasing \\nexpectations of customers, patients, employees, investors, and the general public.  \\n\\nOverall view of the risk and opportunity situation and management assessment \\n\\nThe most significant individual risks or risk clusters have been named in the report above, with business- and \\nmarket-related risks being the most significant alongside IT and legal risks. Most notably, the still ongoing \\nCovid-19 pandemic and global macroeconomic and geo-political developments increase existing risks related to \\nmore restrictive regulatory requirements regarding drug pricing and reimbursement, the demand for our \\nproducts, business interruptions at our production sites, lack of availability of good quality materials or services, \\nand risks related to research and development. \\n\\nFollowing the risk mitigation measures taken – such as the implementation of management action \\n(organizational responsibility and process improvements), existing insurance coverage, and accounting \\nprecautions – we were able to take counteraction, in particular against significant individual risks. \\n\\nThe overall risk of the Group, which is derived from the probability-weighted aggregation of the identified risks, \\nleads to the assessment that an existence-threatening risk-scenario, for which coverage and financing of the \\nlosses are questionable, is highly improbable. We are convinced that we will also successfully manage the \\nabove-mentioned challenges in the future and benefit from diversification through our different products and \\nmarkets. For our assessment of the appropriateness and effectiveness of the risk management system and the \\ninternal control system we refer to the Statement on Corporate Governance.  \\n\\nIn our view, business-related opportunities offer the greatest potential. The activities listed hold significant \\nopportunities for us in the medium to long term, beyond the underlying forecast period. We pursue the \\nopportunities that arise and specify their expected effects in the forecast development of net sales, EBITDA pre, \\nand operating cash flow. Furthermore, we will actively seek new opportunities, examine their implementation, \\nand drive them forward where appropriate. If opportunities arise in addition to the forecast developments, or \\nthese occur more quickly than anticipated, this could have positive effects on our net assets, financial position, \\nand results of operations.\\n\\n \\n\\x0cCombined Management Report ___ Report on Expected Developments \\n\\n101 \\n\\nReport on Expected \\nDevelopments  \\n\\nThe following report provides a forecast for fiscal 2023 for the Merck Group and its three business sectors: \\nLife Science, Healthcare and Electronics. \\n\\nFundamental assumptions \\n\\nWe do not expect the acquisitions of Erbi Biosystems Inc., USA, and M Chemicals Inc., Korea, the chemical \\nbusiness of Mecaro Co. Ltd., Korea, to have a material portfolio effect at Group level in fiscal 2023 (more \\ndetailed information on these transactions can be found in Note (6) “Acquisitions and divestments” in the Notes \\nto the Consolidated Financial Statements). \\n\\nAgainst the backdrop of macroeconomic and geopolitical circumstances, the forecast is also subject to high \\nuncertainty and volatility in fiscal 2023. It continues to assume an elevated level of inflation. Countermeasures \\nwill be taken to soften the expected negative effects as far as possible. Renewed outbreaks of Covid-19, in \\ncombination with local lockdowns, are not taken into consideration in this forecast.  \\n\\nAs regards the development of exchange rates, we expect a continuing volatile environment due to geopolitical \\nand macroeconomic developments. In contrast to the previous year, we expect a negative foreign exchange \\nimpact in 2023 resulting mainly from the development of the U.S. dollar and the Chinese renminbi. The majority \\nof the remaining currencies are also expected to have negative foreign exchange impacts. The expected negative \\nforeign exchange effects on EBITDA pre of the business sectors will be softened by our foreign currency hedging; \\nhowever, we do not hedge all growth market currencies (see Note (42) “Management of financial risks” in the \\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements). This forecast for 2023 is based on a euro-U.S. dollar exchange \\nrate in a corridor of 1.07 to 1.11. \\n\\nForecast for the Merck Group \\n\\nNet sales \\n\\nFor the Merck Group in fiscal 2023, we expect slight to solid organic net sales growth, driven by all our business \\nsectors. Our core business (excluding Covid-19 sales) is likely to deliver solid to strong growth. We assume \\nnegative foreign exchange effects of between -1% and -4%. \\n\\nEBITDA pre \\n\\nThe forecast for the development of EBITDA pre is organically from a moderate decline to about stable. \\nInflation-related price increases will have a visibly adverse impact on earnings. The forecast foreign exchange \\ndevelopment will likely adversely affect Group EBITDA pre by between -1% and -4%; it is expected to be seen \\nmainly in the Healthcare and Electronics business sectors. \\n\\nOperating cash flow \\n\\nThe forecast for operating cash flow is generally subject to a higher fluctuation corridor than the forecast for net \\nsales and EBITDA pre. We provide an estimate of the development of operating cash flow only for the Group as \\na whole.  \\n\\nThe development of operating cash flow is forecast to be largely in line with operating performance. Positive \\neffects will result from a weaker rise in working capital in comparison with the previous year. Fiscal 2022 \\n\\n \\n\\x0cCombined Management Report ___ Report on Expected Developments \\n\\n102 \\n\\nincluded adverse effects from the increase in inventories to secure production and supply as well as owing to \\nhigher material prices. As in the case of EBITDA pre, we expect impacts from negative foreign exchange effects \\nin fiscal 2023. Overall, our forecast ranges from a moderate decline to a stable development in fiscal 2023. As \\nregards the composition of operating cash flow, we refer to the section entitled “Internal Management \\nSystem” in the combined management report as well as the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement in the \\nConsolidated Financial Statements. \\n\\nForecast for the Life Science business sector \\n\\nNet sales \\n\\nFor the Life Science business sector in fiscal 2023, we forecast slight to moderate organic growth. With respect \\nto our core business, in other words excluding Covid-19-related sales, we expect solid to strong organic growth. \\nIn the core business, the Process Solutions business unit will be the strongest driver of growth. With the \\ndevelopment of the core business, the Life Science Services and Science & Lab Solutions business units will also \\ncontribute positively to growth. We expect sales generated by demand for products in connection with the \\nCovid-19 pandemic to total around € 250 million. This represents a continued decline in comparison with the \\nprevious year (2022: around € 800 million). The growth in our Life Science business sector is currently subject \\nto higher volatility due to the varying developments across product groups and customer segments. Increased \\nresearch and development activity as well as higher production volumes among pharmaceutical companies, \\nespecially in the biopharmaceutical segment, are the key drivers of growth in the core business. We forecast a \\nslight to moderately negative foreign exchange effect. \\n\\nEBITDA pre \\n\\nOur forecast for EBITDA pre of the Life Science business sector for fiscal 2023 ranges from a moderate organic \\ndecline to about stable organic development compared with the previous year. In contrast to the positive \\ndevelopment of demand, we expect inflation-driven price increases to weigh more heavily on earnings. We will \\ntake corresponding measures to counteract this effect if reasonably possible. We forecast a slightly negative \\nforeign exchange effect.  \\n\\nForecast for the Healthcare business sector \\n\\nNet sales \\n\\nFor fiscal 2023, we forecast moderate to solid organic growth of net sales. We expect further significant \\nincreases in sales of Mavenclad® and Bavencio® to contribute substantially to this. For our established portfolio, \\nwe forecast an about stable organic development. This will be driven mainly by the organic growth of our \\nproducts in the Cardiovascular, Metabolism & Endocrinology (CM&E) franchise. The expected decline in sales of \\nRebif® due to continued competitive pressure can thus be offset. We assume a slight to moderately negative \\nforeign exchange effect. \\n\\nEBITDA pre \\n\\nWe expect slight to moderate organic growth of EBITDA pre with further significant contributions from \\nMavenclad® and Bavencio®. On the cost side, the continued inflation-driven high price level will adversely affect \\nearnings. The effects will be dampened as far as possible by strict cost management and continued \\nprioritization of our development pipeline. In fiscal 2023 we expect active portfolio management to lead to \\nincome in the mid to high double-digit million euro range. For Healthcare, we expect negative foreign exchange \\neffects in the high single-digit to low teens percentage range. \\n\\n \\n\\x0cCombined Management Report ___ Report on Expected Developments \\n\\n103 \\n\\nForecast for the Electronics business sector \\n\\nNet sales \\n\\nFor the Electronics business sector, we forecast slight to solid organic net sales growth in fiscal 2023. Despite \\nthe economically and geopolitically challenging circumstances in the market for semiconductor materials, the \\nSemiconductor Solutions business unit will remain the key growth driver. This forecast is based on the \\nassumption that the semiconductor market will recover in the second half of 2023. We expect that the growth \\nof the Semiconductor Solutions business unit will continue to exceed market growth. In particular, the project \\nbusiness will contribute to growth. As expected, sales in the project business will be subject to stronger \\nfluctuations owing to the dependency on major individual orders. We also expect our Surface Solutions business \\nunit to see a positive organic development in fiscal 2023. Sales in our Display Solutions business unit will \\ncontinue to decline organically. This will be attributable to the organic decrease in the Liquid Crystals business, \\nwhich is facing persistent price erosion due to the price pressure common in this industry. We forecast a slight \\nto moderately negative foreign exchange effect. \\n\\nEBITDA pre \\n\\nFor our Electronics business sector, we expect a slight to strong organic decrease in EBITDA pre in fiscal 2023. \\nEarnings will reflect inflation-driven cost increases, which will be seen particularly clearly in material costs. Owing \\nto the price pressure faced by our customers, we assume that we will only be able to pass on costs increases to a \\nlimited extent in the coming quarters. Through active cost management, we will attempt to dampen these effects \\nas far as possible. Owing to the tendencies outlined, the development of EBITDA pre is subject to a higher degree \\nof uncertainty. We assume significantly negative foreign exchange effects on EBITDA pre. \\n\\nCorporate and Other \\n\\nFor Corporate and Other, we expect a significant decrease in costs in fiscal 2023. This is mainly due to the \\npositive effects expected from foreign currency hedging compared with the previous year, which will partly \\noffset negative foreign exchange effects in the business sectors. \\n\\n€ million \\n\\n  Actual results \\n\\n  Forecast for 2023  \\n\\nMerck Group \\n\\n2022 \\n\\nNet sales \\n\\nEBITDA pre \\n\\nOperating  \\n\\ncash flow \\n\\n  •  Slight to solid organic growth \\n\\n22,232 \\n\\n(ex-Covid: solid to strong organic growth) \\n•  Negative foreign exchange effect -1% to -4% \\n\\n6,849 \\n\\n•  Moderate organic decline to about stable organically \\n•  Negative foreign exchange effect -1% to -4% \\n\\n4,259  •  Moderate decline to about stable \\n\\n  •  Slight to moderate organic growth \\n\\nLife Science \\n\\nHealthcare \\n\\nElectronics \\n\\nNet sales \\n\\n10,380 \\n\\n(ex-Covid: solid to strong organic growth) \\n\\nEBITDA pre \\n\\nNet sales \\n\\nEBITDA pre \\n\\nNet sales \\n\\nEBITDA pre \\n\\n•  Slight to moderately negative foreign exchange effect \\n\\n3,760 \\n\\n•  Moderate organic decline to about stable organically \\n•  Slightly negative foreign exchange effect \\n\\n  •  Moderate to solid organic growth \\n\\n7,839 \\n\\n•  Slight to moderately negative foreign exchange effect \\n\\n•  Slight to moderate organic growth \\n•  Negative foreign exchange effect in a high single-digit to low teens \\n\\n2,477 \\n\\npercentage range \\n\\n  •  Slight to solid organic growth \\n\\n4,013 \\n\\n•  Slight to moderately negative foreign exchange effect \\n\\n1,192 \\n\\n•  Slight to strong organic decline \\n•  Significantly negative foreign exchange effect \\n\\nCorporate and Other \\n\\n EBITDA pre \\n\\n-579   •  Significant decline in costs \\n\\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cCombined Management Report ___ Report in Accordance with section 315a of the German Commercial Code (HGB) \\n\\n104 \\n\\nReport in Accordance with \\nsection 315a of the German \\nCommercial Code (HGB) \\n\\nThe following information is provided in accordance with section 315a of the German Commercial Code (HGB) \\nand the explanatory report pursuant to section 176 (1) sentence 1 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG). \\n\\nAs of the balance sheet date, the company’s subscribed capital is divided into 129,242,251 no-par value bearer \\nshares plus one registered share. Each share therefore corresponds to € 1.30 of the share capital. The holder of \\nthe registered share is E. Merck Beteiligungen KG. It is entitled and obliged to appoint one-third of the \\nmembers of the Supervisory Board representing the limited liability shareholders. If the holder of the registered \\nshare is a general partner, he or she has no such right of appointment. The transfer of the registered share \\nrequires the company’s approval. The approval is granted at the sole discretion of the personally liable general \\npartner with an equity interest, namely E. Merck KG. \\n\\nPursuant to the information on voting rights submitted to us in accordance with the German Securities Trading \\nAct (WpHG), on December 31, 2022, no shareholders owned direct or indirect investments exceeding 10% of \\nthe voting rights. \\n\\nAccording to the Articles of Association of Merck, the general partners not holding an equity interest who form \\nthe Executive Board are admitted by E. Merck KG with the consent of a simple majority of the other general \\npartners. A person may be a general partner not holding an equity interest only if he or she is also a general \\npartner of E. Merck KG. In addition, at the proposal of E. Merck KG and with the approval of all general partners \\nnot holding an equity interest, further persons who are not general partners not holding an equity interest may \\nbe appointed to the Executive Board. \\n\\nThe Articles of Association can be amended by a resolution at the Annual Meeting that requires the approval of \\nthe general partners. Notwithstanding any statutory provisions to the contrary, the resolutions of the Annual \\nGeneral Meeting are adopted by a simple majority of the votes cast. Where the law requires a capital majority \\nin addition to the voting majority, resolutions are adopted by a simple majority of the share capital represented \\nin the vote. The Articles of Association of the company encompass authorized and contingent capital. \\n\\nThe Executive Board is authorized to increase the company’s share capital with the approval of the Supervisory \\nBoard and of E. Merck KG on one or more occasions, up to and including April 21, 2027, by a total of up to \\n€ 56,521,124.19 by issuing new no-par value bearer shares in exchange for cash and/or non-cash contributions \\n(Authorized Capital 2022). Limited liability shareholders are generally granted statutory rights to subscribe to \\nthe new shares. However, the Executive Board is authorized, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, to \\nexclude limited liability shareholders’ subscription rights, either in full or in part, in the case of a capital \\nincrease in exchange for cash contributions pursuant to or by analogous application of section 186 (3) sentence \\n4 AktG, if the issue price of the new shares is not substantially lower than the stock exchange price of the \\ncompany’s shares already listed and if the new shares issued under exclusion of these subscription rights do \\nnot exceed a proportional amount of 10% of the share capital either at the time of Authorized Capital \\n2022 taking effect or being utilized. This restriction to 10% of the share capital shall include the proportional \\namount of the share capital that is attributable to shares that are issued under exclusion of subscription rights \\nor sold during the term of Authorized Capital 2022, based on an authorization to issue new shares or sell own \\nshares by direct or analogous application of section 186 (3) sentence 4 AktG. This restriction shall also include \\nthe proportional amount of the share capital that is attributable to shares which may or must be issued in order \\nto service bonds carrying a conversion or option right or a conversion or option obligation, if the bonds are \\n\\n \\n\\x0cCombined Management Report ___ Report in Accordance with section 315a of the German Commercial Code (HGB) \\n\\n105 \\n\\nissued during the term of Authorized Capital 2022 under exclusion of limited liability shareholders’ subscription \\nrights by analogous application of section 186 (3) sentence 4 AktG. \\n\\nIt is likewise possible to exclude the subscription rights of limited liability shareholders with the approval of the \\nSupervisory Board in the case of capital increases in exchange for non-cash contributions, particularly for the \\npurpose of acquiring enterprises, parts of enterprises, or interests in enterprises. In addition, with the approval \\nof the Supervisory Board, limited liability shareholders’ subscription rights can be excluded in order to enable \\nE. Merck KG to exercise its right pursuant to article 32 (3) of the company’s Articles of Association to \\nparticipate in a capital increase by issuing shares or freely transferable share subscription rights. \\n\\nIt is likewise possible to exclude, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, the subscription rights of limited \\nliability shareholders in order to enable E. Merck KG to exercise its right pursuant to article 33 of the Articles of \\nAssociation to convert its equity interest into share capital, either in full or in part. \\n\\nMoreover, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, the subscription rights of limited liability shareholders \\ncan be excluded if and to the extent this is necessary to grant the holders or creditors of conversion or option \\nrights, and/or the holders or creditors of financing instruments carrying conversion or option obligations, which \\nwere or are issued by the company or by a domestic or foreign company in which the company directly or \\nindirectly holds the majority of the votes and capital, subscription rights to the extent to which they would be \\nentitled after the exercise of the conversion or option rights or after the performance of a conversion or option \\nobligation. \\n\\nFinally, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, the subscription rights of limited liability shareholders can \\nbe excluded in order to offset any fractional amounts resulting from a capital increase. \\n\\nThe sum of shares issued on the basis of Authorized Capital 2022 under exclusion of limited liability \\nshareholders’ subscription rights must not exceed a proportional amount of 10% of the share capital, taking \\ninto account other shares of the company which, during the term of Authorized Capital 2022, are sold or issued \\nunder exclusion of subscription rights or which are to be issued under bonds issued after April 22, 2022, under \\nexclusion of subscription rights; this limitation shall apply both at the time of this authorization taking effect \\nand at the time of this authorization being exercised. \\n\\nTo the extent that subscription rights are not excluded under the above provisions, they may also be granted to \\nlimited liability shareholders by way of indirect subscription rights pursuant to section 186 (5) AktG or, in part, \\nby way of direct subscription rights, and otherwise by way of indirect subscription rights pursuant to \\nsection 186 (5) AktG. Furthermore, the Executive Board is authorized, with the approval of the Supervisory \\nBoard, to determine the additional details of the capital increase and its implementation, including the content \\nof rights attached to the shares as well as the terms and conditions of the share issue. \\n\\nThe Articles of Association also encompass contingent capital. The share capital is contingently increased by up \\nto € 66,406,298.40 composed of 51,081,768 shares (Contingent Capital I). The contingent capital increase \\nserves to grant exchange rights to E. Merck KG in accordance with article 33 of the Articles of Association to \\nenable the conversion of its equity interest. The shares carry dividend rights from the beginning of the fiscal \\nyear following the year in which the conversion option is exercised. \\n\\nMoreover, the share capital is contingently increased by up to € 16,801,491.20 composed of up to 12,924,224 \\nno par value bearer shares (Contingent Capital II). This contingent capital increase is only to be implemented \\ninsofar as the bearers or creditors of option or conversion rights, or with an obligation to convert or exercise \\noptions on warrant bonds, option participation certificates, option participation bonds, convertible bonds, \\nconvertible participation certificates, or convertible participation bonds issued in exchange for contributions that \\nare issued or guaranteed by the company or a subordinate Group company on the basis of the authorization \\nresolution of the Annual General Meeting of April 27, 2018, to April 26, 2023, utilize their option or conversion \\nrights, or to fulfill their conversion obligation or obligation to exercise options insofar as they are obliged to \\nfulfill their conversion or option exercise obligation, or insofar as the company exercises an option, in full or in \\npart, to grant shares in the company instead of paying the sum of money due, and to the extent that in each \\n\\n \\n\\x0cCombined Management Report ___ Report in Accordance with section 315a of the German Commercial Code (HGB) \\n\\n106 \\n\\ncase a cash settlement is not granted, or own shares or other forms of fulfillment are used. Each issue of new \\nshares shall take place at the determined option or conversion price, pursuant to the aforementioned \\nauthorization resolution. The new shares participate in the profit from the beginning of the fiscal year in which \\nthey are created; insofar as this is legally permissible, the Executive Board may, with the approval of the \\nSupervisory Board, and in deviation from section 60 (2) AktG, stipulate that the new shares also participate in \\nthe profit for a past fiscal year. The Executive Board is authorized, with the approval of the Supervisory Board \\nand of E. Merck KG, to stipulate the further details of the implementation of the increase in contingent capital. \\n\\nThe company is not authorized to acquire its own shares. \\n\\nThe company has not entered into any material agreements subject to a change of control pursuant to a \\ntakeover offer, nor has it entered into any compensation agreements with the members of the Executive Board \\nor employees in the event of a takeover offer.\\n\\n \\n\\x0cCombined Management Report ___ Non-Financial Statement ___ Fundamentals \\n\\n107  \\n\\nNon-Financial Statement** \\n\\nThe combined management report of Merck KGaA and the Merck Group for the fiscal year 2022 includes a \\ncombined non-financial statement in accordance with sections 315b and 315c in conjunction with 289b to 289e \\nof the German Commercial Code (HGB) in the form of a separate chapter.

Our Sustainability Report 2022 is produced in accordance with GRI Standards. It \\nwill be available online as of April 13, 2023. With this, we also disclose topics set forth by Sustainability \\nAccounting Standards Board (SASB) and Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). \\n\\nDescription of our business model\\n\\nOur business model as well as our Group structure, governance and strategy are described under \\n“Fundamental Information about the Group”. \\n\\nGovernance \\n\\nThe requirements we place on responsible corporate governance are derived from our company values on the \\none hand and from the regulations, external initiatives, and international guidelines to which we are committed \\non the other hand. We have integrated these requirements into our sustainability strategy and our Group-\\nwide guidelines. These guidelines comprise charters and principles that are valid for the entire company as \\nwell as specific standards and procedures for individual business sectors and sites. \\n\\nSome examples: Our Human Rights Charter aligns with the UN Guiding Principles for Business and Human \\nRights. Our Group-wide Social and Labor Standards Policy reflects the labor standards of the International \\nLabour Organization (ILO). Our EHS Policy (Corporate Environment, Health and Safety Policy) for \\nenvironmental impact mitigation and health and safety forms the basis for implementing the chemical \\nindustry’s Responsible Care® Global Charter within our company. Our standard entitled Corporate Chemicals \\nRegulations Governance describes the processes and management structures required to ensure global \\ncompliance with the pertinent chemical and product safety regulations. \\n\\nWe comply with all applicable laws as a matter of principle. Where necessary, we review our internal guidelines, \\nstandards and instruction manuals on compliant behavior and adapt them to reflect changes in the regulatory \\nlandscape. \\n\\nRoles and responsibilities \\n\\nBased on the requirements set forth in charters, principles and policies, our internal standards give specific \\nguidance for operational processes. They are constantly updated by the relevant departments and are available \\non our intranet. Our managers implement these standards in their respective areas of responsibility and ensure \\nthat they are adhered to. In addition, we educate and train our employees on all guidelines that apply to them. \\n\\nWe employ management systems to steer processes and define goals, actions, and responsibilities. These \\nsystems are based on standards such as the internationally recognized quality management standard \\nISO 9001, good working practices (GxP) in the pharmaceutical industry and ISO 14001 for environmental \\n\\n** The summarized non-financial statement was not part of the audit of the financial statements but was subject to a separate limited assurance audit by \\nKPMG. \\n\\n \\n\\x0cCombined Management Report ___ Non-Financial Statement ___ Fundamentals \\n\\n108  \\n\\nmanagement. Our company regularly undergoes ISO 14001 and ISO 9001 certification, which are conducted \\nby an independent auditing firm. We hold group certificates for both standards. \\n\\nWe support the following responsible governance initiatives: \\n\\n•  United Nations Global Compact \\n\\n•  Chemical industry’s Responsible Care® Global Charter \\n\\n•  Company network Together for Sustainability (TfS) \\n\\n•  Pharmaceutical Supply Chain Initiative (PSCI) \\n\\n• \\n\\nInitiative Chemie3, a collaboration between the German Chemical Industry Association (VCI), the German \\nEmployers’ Federation of the Chemical Industry (BAVC), and the German Mining, Chemical and Energy \\nIndustrial Union (IG BCE). \\n\\nStrategic and organizational approach to sustainability \\n\\nThe world is facing multiple challenges that we too as a company face. These include climate change, \\ninternational conflicts and economic crises, for instance. Our ambition is to leverage science and technology to \\nachieve sustainable progress for mankind.  \\n\\nWe describe our sustainability strategy in the “Strategy” section of the management report within the Annual \\nReport for 2022 and, in more detail, in the Sustainability Report for 2022 in the chapter entitled “Sustainability \\nStrategy”.  \\n\\nMeasuring progress made with the sustainability strategy \\n\\nOn the basis of 14 key indicators, which we defined back in 2021, we record and assess our progress towards \\nachieving our sustainability goals. In 2022, we implemented various digital working tools that we believe will \\nallow us gain greater transparency with regard to our achievements. Moreover, we added a sustainability factor \\nto the Merck Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) in 2022. It measures the performance of three selected \\nsustainability goals over a period of three years, thus making it possible to increase or reduce target \\nachievement resulting from the key financial performance indicators by up to 20%. Details on how this \\nsustainability factor is calculated can be found in the Compensation report. \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cCombined Management Report ___ Non-Financial Statement ___ Fundamentals \\n\\n109  \\n\\nGoal 1: In 2030, we will achieve human progress for more than one billion people through sustainable science \\nand technology. \\n\\nFocus area \\n\\n Sustainability key indicator \\n\\n  Further details \\n\\nSustainability innovation and technology \\n\\n• Percentage of newly published patent \\n\\nfamilies with positive sustainability impact \\n\\nSustainable innovation & \\ntechnologies \\n\\nHealth and wellbeing impact \\n\\n • People treated with our Healthcare products1  \\n\\nWill be published in the SASB \\nindex as of April 13, 2023 \\n\\nGoal 2: By 2030, we will integrate sustainability into all our value chains. \\n\\nFocus area \\n\\n Sustainability key indicator \\n\\n  Further details \\n\\nSustainability culture \\nand values \\n\\nSustainable and transparent supply chain \\n\\nSecuring our social license to operate in all \\nregions \\n\\n • Percentage of women in leadership positions    Diversity, equity and inclusion \\n\\n• Percentage of employees trained on \\n\\nsustainability \\n\\n  Attracting and retaining talent \\n\\n• Percentage of relevant suppliers (in terms of \\nnumber and supplier spend) that are covered \\nby a valid sustainability assessment1 \\n\\n  Responsible supply chain \\n\\n• Environment, Health and Safety (EHS) \\n\\nIncident Rate \\n\\n• Violations of Global Social and Labor \\n\\nStandards Policy \\n\\n  Process, plant and transport safety \\n\\n  Human rights \\n\\n • Lost Time Injury Rate (LTIR) \\n\\n  Health and safety \\n\\n1The key indicator is used to determine the sustainability factor for the Merck Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP). \\n\\nGoal 3: By 2040, we will achieve climate neutrality and reduce our resource consumption. \\n\\nFocus area \\n\\n Sustainability key indicator \\n\\n  Further details \\n\\nClimate change and emissions \\n\\n • Greenhouse gas emissions (Scope 1+2)1 \\n\\n  Climate action \\n\\n • Indirect greenhouse gas emissions (Scope 3)   Climate action \\n\\n• Percentage of purchased electricity from \\n\\nrenewable sources \\n\\n  Climate action \\n\\nWater and resource intensity \\n\\n • Waste Score \\n\\nWill be published in the \\nSustainability Report 2022 as of \\nApril 13, 2023 \\n\\n • Water Intensity Score \\n\\n  Water management \\n\\nWater and resource intensity \\n\\n • Wastewater quality \\n\\n1The key indicator is used to determine the sustainability factor for the Merck Long -Term Incentive Plan (LTIP). \\n\\nWill be published in the \\nSustainability Report 2022 as of \\nApril 13, 2023 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n    \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n    \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n    \\n \\n \\n\\x0cCombined Management Report ___ Non-Financial Statement ___ Fundamentals \\n\\n110  \\n\\nRoles and responsibilities \\n\\nOur Executive Board has Group-wide responsibility for our sustainability strategy. It has adopted our three \\nstrategic goals. In 2030, we will achieve human progress for more than one billion people through sustainable \\nscience and technology. By 2030, we will integrate sustainability into all our value chains. And by 2040, we will \\nachieve climate neutrality and reduce our resource consumption (details can be found under “Strategy”). \\n\\nThe Group Corporate Sustainability unit is responsible for developing and shaping the sustainability strategy \\nand it informs the Executive Board at least once a year about the progress made and the need for action. It is \\npart of the Group function Corporate Sustainability, Quality and Trade Compliance (SQ), which reports to the \\nChair of the Executive Board. Consequently, overarching Executive Board responsibility for Environment, Social, \\nGovernance (ESG) also lies with the Chair of the Executive Board.  \\n\\nGroup Corporate Sustainability is also responsible for coordinating the Merck Sustainability Board (previously \\nCorporate Sustainability Council), which was set up in 2022. The Merck Sustainability Board is chaired by the \\nHead of SQ and consists of representatives from our business sectors and from key Group functions, such as \\nProcurement, Communications, as well as Controlling and Risk Management. \\n\\nThe Sustainability Board steers and monitors the Group-wide implementation of the sustainability strategy. It \\naligns the strategy with the individual business strategies, defines priorities and specifies globally applicable \\nsustainability guidelines. In addition, the Sustainability Board ensures that the initiatives of our various \\nbusiness sectors, Group functions and subsidiaries align with our global sustainability strategy. Moreover, it \\nrecommends corresponding initiatives to the Executive Board. Within their respective area of responsibility, \\neach Executive Board member is also responsible for sustainability, reviews the priorities that have been set, \\nand decides on the implementation of initiatives. \\n\\nIn 2022, the Sustainability Board met nine times by video conference. The participants addressed the following \\ntopics: Implementing the sustainability strategy in the business sectors, key indicators for measuring and \\nsteering sustainability within the company, lowering greenhouse gas emissions, and supply chain due diligence \\nrequirements. \\n\\nAn external expert committee for sustainability issues has been supporting our company since 2021. The Merck \\nSustainability Advisory Panel (MSAP) consists of six independent experts on sustainability-related topics from \\nseveral institutions worldwide. They advise the members of the Sustainability Board on selected issues and \\nassess the sustainability of our company’s business models as well as planned activities. Moreover, they \\nprovide their external insights to help address societal and political challenges and developments that could be \\nstrategically relevant for our businesses. This panel is chaired by the Head of SQ. \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cCombined Management Report ___ Non-Financial Statement ___ Fundamentals \\n\\n111  \\n\\nTopics for the non-financial statement \\n\\nPursuant to section 289c para 3 of the German Commercial Code, we are obligated to review topics for their \\ndouble materiality. The principle of double materiality requires companies to disclose non-financial information \\nas soon as the following two criteria are met: Firstly, the information makes it possible to understand how the \\ncompany’s business activities affect non-financial aspects. And secondly, the information is necessary to \\nunderstand the company’s course of business, results of operations and economic position. In 2022, we \\nexamined the topics identified within the scope of a materiality analysis in accordance with the Global \\nReporting Initiative standards (GRI) for their double materiality. \\n\\nThe following topics achieved the relevance threshold for double materiality in 2022. They cover fiscal year \\n2022 and pertain to our entire Group. Any deviations from the reporting framework are indicated on a case-by-\\ncase basis. \\n\\nAspect \\n\\n Topic \\n\\nEnvironmental matters \\n\\nEmployee-related matters \\n\\nSocial matters \\n\\n • Environmental management \\n\\n • Climate action \\n\\n • Water management \\n\\n • Plant, process and transport safety \\n\\n • Chemical product safety \\n\\n • Attracting and retaining talent \\n\\n • Diversity, equity and inclusion \\n\\n • Health and safety \\n\\n • Sustainable supply chains (including the mica supply chain) \\n\\n • Patient safety \\n\\n • Prices of medicines \\n\\n • Clinical studies \\n\\n • Bioethics \\n\\n • Digital ethics \\n\\n • Data protection and security \\n\\nRespect for human rights \\n\\n • Human rights \\n\\nAnti-corruption and anti-bribery \\n\\n• Governance and compliance (including anti-corruption anti-competitive \\n\\nbehavior) \\n\\n • Responsible marketing \\n\\n • Interactions with health systems \\n\\nOther topics \\n\\n • Sustainable innovation and research & development \\n\\nAs part of our approach to comprehensive risk and opportunity management, we also identify current and \\npotential risks and opportunities resulting from environmental, social and governance aspects. This includes \\ntracking information on the gross risks in terms of potential damage and probability, as well as the residual net \\nrisks remaining after mitigation measures have been executed. As of the reporting date and pursuant to the \\nrisk analysis of the material non-financial topics, no significant risks within the meaning of section 289c (3) \\nsentence 1 No. 3 and 4 of the German Commercial Code (HGB) from the company’s own business activities or \\nfrom business relationships are known that are very likely to have or will have serious negative effects on non-\\nfinancial aspects. Additional risks are described in the Report on Risks and Opportunities in the combined \\nmanagement report. \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cCombined Management Report ___ Non-Financial Statement ___ Environmental matters \\n\\n112  \\n\\nEnvironmental matters \\n\\nEnvironmental protection \\n\\nMinimizing negative environmental impacts and taking meaningful climate action requires a holistic approach \\nwhile also constantly monitoring practices and performance. Our goal is to decouple business growth from \\nnegative environmental impacts wherever possible. Our production sites are located in established industrial \\nand commercial zones. Before acquiring a company – and thus its facilities – we first conduct an environmental \\nrisk assessment, taking into consideration information from publicly accessible sources such as local residents \\nand non-governmental organizations (NGOs). \\n\\nRoles and responsibilities \\n\\nThe Chair of the Executive Board and CEO of our company is responsible for environmental protection, which \\nalso covers climate action, water management, waste and recycling, biodiversity, and plant and process safety. \\nHer duties include the approval of overarching Group-wide guidelines such as our EHS Policy. Furthermore, the \\nMerck Sustainability Board (MSB) monitors the Group-wide implementation of environmental protection goals.  \\n\\nThe Group function Corporate Sustainability, Quality and Trade Compliance (SQ) is responsible for steering all \\nthe related measures globally. SQ senior leadership approves operational standards and regularly reports on \\nenvironmental protection to the Executive Board. Every year, SQ prepares a comprehensive environment, \\nhealth and safety report that covers topics such as climate action, water management, waste and recycling, \\nand plant and process safety. The Executive Board uses this report to steer the strategic direction and as \\nverification for our ISO 14001 certifications. Additionally, the Executive Board receives a monthly update so \\nthat measures can be adjusted in a timely manner. \\n\\nWithin our business sectors, the Operations Leadership Committee (OLC) makes strategic decisions on issues \\npertaining to emissions, energy, water, and waste topics. This body consists of representatives from Life Science, \\nHealthcare and Electronics as well as from SQ. Decisions made by the OLC and any resulting actions are \\nimplemented by the respective business sector. Once per quarter, the OLC members update their leaders on \\nmatters relating to environmental protection, and this information, if relevant, is then shared with the MSB. \\n\\nOur commitment: Standards and standard operating procedures \\n\\nOur approach to environmental management is founded on our Group EHS (Environment, Health and Safety) \\nPolicy, which has been approved by our Executive Board. Aligned with the requirements of the chemical \\nindustry’s Responsible Care® Global Charter and the ISO 14001 environmental management standard, this \\npolicy underscores our leaders’ responsibility for environmental stewardship and health and safety. It is also \\naimed at our suppliers, calling on them to likewise adopt higher standards of environmental sustainability and \\nsafety. Our EHS policy thus complements the Supplier code of conduct (formerly Responsible Sourcing \\nPrinciples) of our Group Procurement function. Through our Contractor EHS Management Standard we aim to \\nensure that our contract partners also take environment, health and safety aspects into account. \\n\\nPotential EHS risks posed by acquisitions, divestments or site closures are assessed within the scope of due \\ndiligence, a process defined in our EHS Due Diligence and Post Merger Transaction Standard. We prioritize new \\nsites when performing audits. \\n\\nMaterial investments in environmental impact mitigation \\n\\nEfforts to prevent and monitor air, water and soil emissions entail significant expense on our part, as does \\nproper waste disposal. Moreover, we set up provisions for groundwater and soil remediation to ensure that we \\ncan execute all the necessary measures. As of December 31, 2022, our provisions for environmental \\nprotection totaled € 148 million, 94% of which was attributable to Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany. \\n\\n \\n \\n\\x0cCombined Management Report ___ Non-Financial Statement ___ Environmental matters \\n\\n113  \\n\\nAssessing environmental impacts \\n\\nAs a matter of principle, we conduct risk-based assessments along with audits of all our production facilities \\nevery three years with the goal of analyzing and minimizing our environmental footprint. Conducted by \\nCorporate Sustainability, Quality and Trade Compliance (SQ), these assessments serve to ensure that our \\nrequirements are being met, with appropriate corrective measures being implemented as needed. In our Group \\nEHS audits, we assess our sites’ performance on a five-tier scale (“excellent”, “good”, “satisfactory”, “poor” \\nand “critical”), which in turn determines how frequently audits are conducted. If the findings are deemed to be \\ngood, we audit the facility less often, while significant violations can increase the frequency. In 2022, we \\ncommissioned a total of 41 audits, which were conducted either virtually or on site. Almost all audited sites \\nreceived either a “good”, “satisfactory” rating, one site was rated “poor” and no sites were rated as “critical\". \\n\\nReporting incidents and violations \\n\\nTo review critical situations, near misses and environmental incidents as quickly as possible and take \\ncountermeasures, we have a set of reporting procedures in place that allow us to track the respective incident, \\nits degree of severity and all risk mitigation efforts. We record all incidents Group-wide and report them to the \\nExecutive Board on an annual basis. \\n\\nIn the event of a major occurrence, our digital Rapid Incident Report System (RIRS) promptly notifies SQ and \\nGroup Communications functions, who, if necessary, inform the Executive Board. Major incidents could include \\nfatalities, accidents with multiple casualties, incidents that impact neighboring communities or natural disasters \\nsuch as earthquakes and flooding. Through the RIRS, we can quickly coordinate with all those involved and \\ninform the other sites immediately of the respective event. In addition, employees as well as external \\nstakeholders can report any violations of our standards to Group Compliance. \\n\\nIn 2022, we recorded two significant incident-related spills. One took place at a production site in Germany, the \\nother one in the USA. In neither case were people injured nor were negative environmental impacts expected, \\nwhich is why it was not necessary to communicate these incidents to the public. \\n\\nISO 14001:2015 Group certificate \\n\\nSince 2009, our company has held an ISO 14001 Group certificate that requires all production sites with more \\nthan 50 employees to implement an environmental management system with predefined indicators such as \\ngreenhouse gas emissions and water consumption. Other facilities are not obligated to undergo certification. \\nThe annual internal audit reports and management reviews carried out under the Group certificate give us a \\nbetter overview of how all our sites are performing. In 2022, 95 of our sites worldwide were covered by the \\nISO 14001 certificate. \\n\\nAnnual external audits are used to monitor our certifications. As part of a defined sample procedure for the \\nGroup certificate, a total of 12 sites were externally audited in 2022, with all audited facilities passing. In \\naddition to external inspections, internal audits serve to ensure Group-wide compliance with our requirements. \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cCombined Management Report ___ Non-Financial Statement ___ Environmental matters \\n\\n114  \\n\\nClimate action \\n\\nWe want to do our part to preserve the climate and comply with the Paris Agreement on climate change. \\nTherefore, we have set our own objectives: \\n\\nBy 2030, we intend to lower our direct (Scope 1) and indirect (Scope 2) greenhouse gas emissions by 50% \\ncompared with 2020. We aim to achieve this mainly by reducing process-related emissions, implementing \\nenergy efficiency measures and purchasing more electricity from renewable sources.  \\n\\nIn May 2022, this near-term goal for 2030 was approved by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), which \\nindependently assesses and approves company targets based on its strict climate science criteria. With this \\nconfirmation, we are contributing to limiting global warming to 1.5\\u202f°C, thus complying with the requirements of \\nthe Paris Agreement. \\n\\nWe also aim to cover 80% of our purchased electricity with renewables by 2030. \\n\\nMoreover, we aim to reduce our Scope 3 emissions across the entire value chain by 52% (per euro of gross \\nprofit) by 2030. This target was also approved by SBTi. \\n\\nBy 2040, we intend to have achieved climate-neutral operations throughout our entire value chain; this target \\ncovers our Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions. \\n\\nRoles and responsibilities \\n\\nCorporate Sustainability, Quality and Trade Compliance (SQ) is responsible for overseeing all climate action \\nefforts throughout the Group, with our individual sites and business sectors worldwide implementing the \\nnecessary measures at the local level. You can find more information under “Environmental protection”.  \\n\\nOur commitment: Standards and legal frameworks \\n\\nWe have three EHS standards in place to manage energy and process-related emissions consistently across the \\nGroup, specifically “Energy Management”, “Emissions” and “Emissions of Refrigerants”. We utilize an internal \\naudit process to randomly check compliance with all EHS standards. \\n\\nEmissions reduced further \\n\\nIn 2022, we reduced our greenhouse gas emissions by nearly 10%, emitting a total of approximately 1,667,000 \\nmetric tons of CO2 equivalents (CO2eq) (2021: 1,843,000 metric tons). Our direct emissions (Scope 1) totaled \\n1,425,000 metric tons of CO2eq, with process-related emissions accounting for 1,167,000 metric tons of CO2eq \\nand fuel use accounting for the remainder. Indirect emissions (Scope 2) totaled roughly 242,000 metric tons \\ncalculated according to the market-based method (approximately 377,000 metric tons according to the \\nlocation-based method). Greenhouse gas emission intensity (Scope 1 and 2) amounted to 0.07 kg of CO2eq per \\n€ of net sales in this period (2021: 0.09).  \\n\\nIn 2022, we focused on creating more transparency on our Scope 3 emissions. The Greenhouse Gas Protocol \\ndefines 15 categories for Scope 3 emissions from upstream and downstream activities. In 2022, these \\nemissions totaled 6,616,000 metric tons of CO2eq. Categories 1 and 2 (Purchased Goods and Services and \\nCapital Goods) accounted for 69% of our total Scope 3 emissions in this period. \\n\\n \\n \\n\\x0cCombined Management Report ___ Non-Financial Statement ___ Environmental matters \\n\\n115  \\n\\nTotal greenhouse gas emissions (Scope 1 and 2 of the GHG Protocol)1,2 \\n\\nmetric kilotons \\n\\nTotal CO2eq4 emissions \\n\\nthereof: \\n\\ndirect CO2eq emissions (Scope 1) \\n\\nindirect CO2eq emissions5 (Scope 2) \\n\\nBiogenic CO2 emissions \\n\\n2019   \\n\\n20203   \\n\\n2021   \\n\\nMerck Group   \\n\\n2022 \\n\\n2022 \\nthereof: Merck KGaA \\n\\n621   \\n\\n2,028   \\n\\n1,843   \\n\\n1,667   \\n\\n341   \\n\\n280   \\n\\n13   \\n\\n1,706   \\n\\n1,522   \\n\\n1,425   \\n\\n322   \\n\\n13   \\n\\n321   \\n\\n15   \\n\\n242   \\n\\n13   \\n\\n148 \\n\\n108 \\n\\n40 \\n\\n0 \\n\\n1 In line with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, for all previous years greenhouse gas emissions were calculated based on the curren t corporate structure as \\nof Dec. 31 of the reporting year and retroactively adjusted for acquisitions or divestments of (parts of)  companies, or for changes in emission factors \\n(portfolio-adjusted). \\n\\n2 Baseline for our emission targets is 2020. \\n\\n3 Includes Versum Materials as of 2020.  \\n\\n4 eq = equivalent \\n\\n5 The figures presented here have been calculated in accordance with the market-based method.  \\n\\nWe have included the following gases in our calculation of direct and indirect CO2eq emissions: \\nDirect CO2 emissions: CO2, HFCs, PFCs, CH4, N2O, NF3, SF6. \\nIndirect CO2 emissions: CO2. \\n\\nOther relevant indirect greenhouse gas emissions (Scope 3 of the GHG Protocol)1 \\n\\n2019   \\n\\n2020   \\n\\n2021   \\n\\n2022 \\n\\nTotal gross other indirect emissions (metric kilotons \\nCO2eq2) \\n\\nPurchased goods & services (category 1)3 \\n\\nCapital goods (Category 2)3 \\n\\nFuel- and energy-related emissions, not included in Scope 1 \\nor 2 (category 3) \\n\\nUpstream transportation & distribution (category 4) 4 \\n\\nWaste generated in operations (category 5) \\n\\nBusiness travel (category 6) \\n\\nEmployee commuting (category 7) \\n\\nUpstream leased assets (category 8)7 \\n\\nDownstream transportation & distribution (category 9)4 \\n\\nProcessing of sold products (category 10)8 \\n\\nUse of sold products (category 11)4 \\n\\nEnd-of-life treatment of sold products (category 12)4 \\n\\nDownstream leased assets (category 13) \\n\\nFranchises (category 14)10 \\n\\nInvestments (category 15) \\n\\n339   \\n\\nn/a   \\n\\nn/a   \\n\\n127   \\n\\nn/a   \\n\\n50   \\n\\n87   \\n\\n75   \\n\\n0   \\n\\nn/a   \\n\\n0   \\n\\nn/a   \\n\\nn/a   \\n\\n0   \\n\\n0   \\n\\nn/a   \\n\\n5,030   \\n\\n3,040   \\n\\n293   \\n\\n102   \\n\\n264   \\n\\n85   \\n\\n32   \\n\\n90   \\n\\n0   \\n\\n8   \\n\\n0   \\n\\n1,091   \\n\\n23   \\n\\n2   \\n\\n0   \\n\\n0   \\n\\n5,716   \\n\\n3,572   \\n\\n291   \\n\\n143   \\n\\n2645   \\n\\n79   \\n\\n26   \\n\\n94   \\n\\n0   \\n\\n85   \\n\\n0   \\n\\n6,616 \\n\\n4,200 \\n\\n388 \\n\\n121 \\n\\n3196 \\n\\n85 \\n\\n78 \\n\\n99 \\n\\n0 \\n\\n66 \\n\\n0 \\n\\n1,213   \\n\\n235   \\n\\n1,2909 \\n\\n269 \\n\\n2   \\n\\n0   \\n\\n1   \\n\\n2 \\n\\n0 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n1 In line with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, for all previous years greenhouse gas emissions were calculated based on the curren t corporate structure as \\nof Dec. 31 of the reporting year and retroactively adjusted for acquisitions or divestments of (parts of)  companies, or for changes in emission factors \\n(portfolio-adjusted). \\n\\n2 eq = equivalent \\n\\n3 The reported figures contain 95-97% of our total spend.

For instance, we improved heating, \\nventilation and air conditioning systems and reduced base loads for compressed air systems. \\n\\nAs part of the energy and water efficiency program of our Life Science business sector, we rolled out new tools \\nand governance structures in 2022 to help us assess projects to save energy and water. The energy and water \\nefficiency program had a capital expenditure budget of € 4.6 million in 2022, which we will increase to \\n€ 9.3 million in 2023. In 2022, we formally trained 18 Facility, Plant Engineering, and EHS Managers from sites \\nglobally on energy management. \\n\\nSlight decline in energy consumption \\n\\nWe consumed 2,432 gigawatt hours of energy in 2022, compared with 2,454 gigawatt hours in 2021.

We are also concerned with addressing water scarcity. To determine \\nwhether a site is located in a water-stressed area, we apply a risk factor of the Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas of \\nthe World Resources Institute (WRI). We want to reduce the environmental impact of our wastewater and make \\nour processes more water-efficient. In the medium term, we will also take into account water-related risks that \\nexist in our supply chain when purchasing important raw materials. In the long term, we intend to transparently \\nmap water use and environmental impacts throughout the entire life cycle of our products. \\n\\nTo this end, we have defined two targets: First, by 2025, we aim to lower our “Merck Water Intensity Score” by \\n10% compared to 2020. Second, by 2030, we want to reduce potentially harmful residues in our wastewater \\nbelow the no-effect threshold; this is a scientifically defined limit below which no negative environmental \\nimpacts are expected. \\n\\nOur regular EHS audits at our production and development facilities also review site-specific water management \\npractices. Our water management efforts focus more heavily on our manufacturing sites than on our \\nadministrative facilities because production generally poses a higher risk to aquatic ecosystems. \\n\\nRoles and responsibilities \\n\\nThe Group function Corporate Sustainability, Quality and Trade Compliance (SQ) is responsible for water \\nmanagement. At our sites, engineers work in close collaboration with our EHS managers to lower water \\nconsumption and treat wastewater. Further information can be found under “Environmental protection”. \\n\\nOur commitment: Standards and procedures \\n\\nOur Group-wide Sustainable Water Management Part 1 – Wastewater, Sustainable Water Management Part 2 – \\nWater Use and Sustainable Management Part 3 – Water Risk Management standards detail how we integrate \\nmechanisms of sustainable water management into our management system. All three standards are based on \\nthe commitments we made under the Responsible Care® initiative. At the same time, our Sustainable water \\nmanagement principles set the framework for the three aforementioned standards.  \\n\\nOur Wastewater Standard defines criteria for assessing our wastewater discharges into the ecosystem. It also \\nhelps us to achieve our target as regards trace substances in wastewater from our operations. The Water Use \\nStandard sets out mandatory Group-wide requirements for the responsible consumption of water. The Water \\nRisk Management standard establishes a way for us to manage the risks that arise from direct or indirect water \\nextraction and also covers risks such as contaminated rainwater and flooding. We perform internal EHS audits to \\nverify that our sites comply with our three standards. They are all required to measure and assess the risks and \\nimpacts of the hazardous substances in their wastewater. Moreover, they must also analyze withdrawal and \\nwastewater risks and comply with the respective requirements of the local authorities. \\n\\nWater withdrawn from our own sources \\n\\nFor the most part, we draw water used for our production processes from our own wells and source drinking \\nwater from local suppliers. In doing so, we do not want water extraction to impair any protected areas, sensitive \\necosystems or habitats. Our aim is to extract less water from our own wells than the amounts approved in our \\npermits. At the same time, we keep an eye on trends that could potentially lead to sources being reclassified in \\nthe future. \\n\\nThe cooling water used for our production processes generally runs in a circular system. Depending on regulatory \\nstandards and the energy footprint, we sometimes use freshwater for cooling in a once-through system. However, \\nthis is only done in regions with high freshwater availability. For certain applications, we treat production \\nwastewater and reuse it. In 2022, we recycled a total of 20.7 million m³ of water (2021: 23.5 m³ of water). \\n\\n \\n \\n\\x0cCombined Management Report ___ Non-Financial Statement ___ Environmental matters \\n\\n118  \\n\\nWater withdrawal \\n\\nmillions of m3 \\n\\nTotal water withdrawal \\n\\nSurface water (rivers, lakes) \\n\\nGroundwater \\n\\nDrinking water (from local suppliers) \\n\\n2019   \\n\\n14.0   \\n\\n1.9   \\n\\n6.8   \\n\\n5.2   \\n\\n2020   \\n\\n14.0   \\n\\n1.8   \\n\\n6.7   \\n\\n5.4   \\n\\n2021   \\n\\n13.5   \\n\\n1.9   \\n\\n6.3   \\n\\n5.2   \\n\\n2022 \\nMerck \\nGroup   \\n\\n13.2   \\n\\n1.8   \\n\\n6.3   \\n\\n5.0   \\n\\nRain water and other sources \\n\\n0.05   \\n\\n0.06   \\n\\n0.06   \\n\\n0.06   \\n\\n2022 \\nWater \\nstress areas \\n\\n0.17 \\n\\n0.004 \\n\\n0.003 \\n\\n0.160 \\n\\n0.004 \\n\\nThese figures do not include the ground water that we use for safety measures at our Gernsheim site in Germany. Here, the water is fed back directly into \\nnatural circulation. \\n\\nUsing water more efficiently \\n\\nWe seek to minimize our impact on water availability in the vicinity of our sites. In 2022, we withdrew \\n13.2 million m³ of water in total (2021: 13.5 million). Local conditions determine whether a sufficient water \\nsupply is available. In our water conservation efforts, we pay particular attention to sites in water-scarce areas. \\nTo improve our water efficiency, we have therefore defined an intensity score – the Merck Water Intensity \\nScore. The score relates to the amount of water either purchased or withdrawn from our own wells at a site to \\nthe number of hours worked, while taking the local availability of water into account. The Gernsheim site \\n(Germany) is excluded from both the score and our water conservation efforts because we must extract a \\nminimum water quantity from our own wells in order to comply with regulatory requirements. In 2022, we \\nlowered the Merck Water Intensity Score by 8.6% in comparison with the baseline year 2020 (2025 target: \\n10% reduction).  \\n\\nOur site in Rio de Janeiro conducted a project to reduce water consumption by upgrading the on-site \\nwastewater treatment plant and reusing treated wastewater in the cooling towers. After two years of \\nimplementation, the average annual volume of water that is reused is approximately 20,000 cubic meter/year, \\nwhich contributes together with other water saving measures to a reduction of 33% of total water intake \\ncompared to 2020. \\n\\nOur wastewater \\n\\nIn 2022, we generated a total of 12.4 million m³ of wastewater (2021: 13.3 million). This consisted of around \\n8.6 million m³ of freshwater, which we discharged into surface waters. 3.8 million m³ was classified as “other \\nwater” and was treated at external treatment plants or disposed of in an ecologically sustainable manner. \\n\\nWastewater volume \\n\\nTotal wastewater volume (millions of m3) \\n\\nWastewater discharged directly \\n\\nWastewater discharged to third parties \\n\\n2019   \\n\\n13.2   \\n\\n9.3   \\n\\n3.8   \\n\\n2020   \\n\\n13.4   \\n\\n9.2   \\n\\n4.1   \\n\\n2021   \\n\\n13.3   \\n\\n9.5   \\n\\n3.8   \\n\\n2022 \\nMerck \\nGroup   \\n\\n12.4   \\n\\n8.6   \\n\\n3.8   \\n\\n2022 \\nWater \\nstress areas \\n\\n0.130 \\n\\n0.000 \\n\\n0.110 \\n\\nWe continuously work to optimize our production streams and purification processes in order to conserve water \\nand minimize residues.

These include specifications that determine how special risk analyses \\nand hazard assessments are to be carried out. We have also defined measures for the event of accidental \\nrelease of chemical substances and for fire protection. \\n\\nOur Group-wide EHS standards stipulate the safety levels for the storage of hazardous materials at our sites. \\nAlong with supplementary standard operating procedures and best practice documents, these EHS standards \\ndescribe the technology, equipment and organizational infrastructure needed to achieve the appropriate safety \\nlevels. Contract warehouses must also adhere to our strict safety requirements. Before we sign a contract with \\nan operator, they must submit a statement detailing how they meet our prerequisites. Our Group-wide EHS \\nstandards also define the technical and organizational requirements for such warehouses. \\n\\nOur Group Transport Safety Standard is based on the United Nations Recommendations on the Transport of \\nDangerous Goods. This guideline is especially important for sites in countries with inadequate local regulations \\ncovering the conveyance of hazardous materials. \\n\\nAssessing potential risks \\n\\nBefore commissioning a plant, we draft a safety concept, which is subject to continuous review throughout the \\nentire lifetime of the facility. It is updated as needed until the facility is decommissioned. This safety concept \\ncontains an overview of potential risks and specifies corresponding protective measures. In the event that \\nalterations are made to a plant, we reassess the hazard and risk situation. Our Risk Management Process guides \\nall our sites in identifying and assessing risks and serves to devise further measures to minimize them. \\n\\nWe use internal EHS audits to complement the inspections conducted by our EHS and dangerous goods managers \\nin order to ensure that our sites comply with process, plant, transport, and storage safety regulations. Normally, \\nthese audits are conducted every three years at production sites and every four years at warehouse and \\ndistribution sites. If major shortcomings are identified, we re-audit the respective site the following year. \\nConversely, we may decide to extend the period between audits at facilities where, based on the findings from \\nprevious audits, we deem the potential risk to be low. Our sites are required to rectify any deficiencies discovered \\nduring the audit, with the auditor subsequently checking whether the specified corrective actions have been taken. \\nIn 2022, we conducted 41 EHS audits in accordance with our Group-wide EHS standards.  \\n\\n \\n \\n\\x0cCombined Management Report ___ Non-Financial Statement ___ Environmental matters \\n\\n120  \\n\\nKeeping a close eye on safety \\n\\nWe track EHS performance indicators at all production and warehouse facilities, as well as at major research \\nsites, including both accidents and near misses. We investigate each individual incident and then devise \\nappropriate countermeasures in an effort to reduce the likelihood of such events reoccurring in the future. EHS \\nperformance indicator data are reported once a month within each business sector, with the Executive Board \\nreceiving reports on the topic once per year. Four indicators are particularly important to us: \\n\\n•  Under our EHS Incident Rate (EHS IR), we track and evaluate all major and minor accidents and incidents as \\n\\nwell as further EHS-relevant incidents. The EHS IR covers both our own employees as well as those of \\ncontractors. To calculate it, we state the number of incidents and the severity of the event in relation to the \\nnumber of hours worked. The lower the EHS Incident Rate, the safer the site is. In 2022, the ratio was 2.8 \\n(2021: 3.9). The significantly lower rate is attributable to the fact that we have now fully included all office \\nsites in the assessment. \\n\\n•  The EHS IR also includes our Loss of Primary Containment (LoPC) indicator. In 2022, we recorded two \\nsignificant incident-related spills. One took place at a production site in Germany, the other one in the \\nUnited States. In neither case were people injured nor were negative environmental impacts expected, \\nwhich is why it was not necessary to communicate these incidents to the public. \\n\\n•  The EHS Leading Rate (EHS LR) reflects the number and the results of the analyses of near misses and \\n\\ncritical situations.  \\n\\n•  For the Lost Time Injury Rate (LTIR) we set ourselves the goal of bringing our Group-wide LTIR below 1.0 by \\n\\n2025 (number of accidents Group-wide resulting in at least one missed day of work per million hours \\nworked). In 2022, our LTIR of 1.2 remained unchanged in comparison with the previous year. \\n\\nChemical product safety \\n\\nProduct safety is one of our top priorities. During the product development phase, we investigate the potential \\nadverse impacts of chemical substances. Along the entire value chain of our products – from raw materials to \\nmanufacture and commercialization – we provide relevant information on their hazardous properties and how to \\ndeal with them. These instructions facilitate the safe handling and use of our products in line with all regulatory \\nrequirements. We publish this information primarily on the relevant digital channels. As paper safety data \\nsheets are still common in some countries, we can also provide these upon request through our customer \\nservice. \\n\\nRoles and responsibilities \\n\\nOur Life Science, Healthcare and Electronics business sectors have organizational structures to implement our \\nproduct safety strategy in line with their respective business requirements and customer needs. This approach \\nincludes registering chemicals, classifying hazardous substances, and highlighting risks using safety data \\nsheets, labels and digital communication tools. \\n\\nOur Group standards provide a framework for governing the set-up of effective operational processes for \\nproduct safety, hazard communication and chemicals regulatory compliance throughout our business sectors. In \\naddition, the Group Chemicals Regulations Council fosters cross-sectoral alignment of strategic regulatory \\nactivities required for existing and emerging chemicals regulations as well as sustainability and identifies \\npotential impacts for our company. \\n\\nThis approach also applies to innovative fields of development such as nanomaterials, which we use with the \\ngreatest of care in line with the precautionary principle. Furthermore, our Group-wide Policy for Use and \\nHandling of Nanomaterials provides the necessary guidance on the use of these materials. \\n\\n \\n \\n\\x0cCombined Management Report ___ Non-Financial Statement ___ Environmental matters \\n\\n121  \\n\\nLegal requirements and internal guidelines \\n\\nOur internal guidelines define the roles, responsibilities and basic processes required to comply with national \\nand international regulations. In addition, we have also endorsed voluntary commitments of the chemical \\nindustry such as the Responsible Care® Global Charter. Using the Globally Harmonized System for \\nClassification and Labelling of Chemicals (GHS) for hazard communication allows us to streamline our internal \\nprocesses and provide consistent, harmonized, and high-quality information to our customers. \\n\\nIn 2022, there were no incidents of non-compliance with regulations specifically concerning potential health and \\nsafety impacts and the labeling of our chemical products. \\n\\nSafety analysis of our products \\n\\nSafe and sustainable by design implies that product safety starts during development. Therefore, at an early \\nstage of our product development process, we analyze innovations in terms of their impacts on human health \\nand the environment. We continuously evaluate the intrinsic hazards of both our existing and new products to \\ncreate relevant product safety information in line with all applicable rules. \\n\\nProduct safety information \\n\\nChemical product safety is all about protecting human health and the environment from adverse impacts \\nresulting from the use of chemical products throughout their life cycle. To achieve this, we provide all relevant \\ninformation to our customers and the public, which helps to raise awareness of the hazards and build a greater \\nunderstanding of how to mitigate risks and use the products safely. \\n\\nTo obtain all the relevant information on hazard profiles, we employ industry-standard digital tools that gather \\nall information available on the substances we use.\\n\\n \\n \\n\\x0cCombined Management Report ___ Non-Financial Statement ___ Employee-related matters \\n\\n122  \\n\\nEmployee-related matters \\n\\nAttracting and retaining talent \\n\\nTo ensure our ongoing success, we are focusing on the future by creating meaningful impacts and building needed \\ncapabilities. At the same time, we must respond to changing demographics and adapt to the behaviors and \\nexpectations of the highly competitive talent market. Therefore, in 2022, we enhanced our talent acquisition \\nstrategy with a more personal, employee-focused approach. Our goals include reinventing our talent sourcing \\napproach to build targeted and integrated pipelines and effectively recruiting diverse talent to our organization. \\n\\nWe have designed our compensation structure to provide valuable benefits to our employees and their families. \\nOur reward system recognizes the uniqueness of our employees while providing flexibility wherever possible. \\nThrough our competitive compensation structure, we aim to be attractive to future employees in particular. \\nAdditionally, our international employee mobility programs create an environment suited to the needs of a \\nrapidly evolving workforce. \\n\\nWe have revised our talent retention approach by tailoring our retention efforts more strongly to different \\ntarget groups and countries as well as striving to create an inclusive environment that sparks our employees’ \\ncreativity and growth. \\n\\nTotal number of employees1 \\n\\nAs of Dec. 31 \\n\\n2019   \\n\\n2020   \\n\\n2021   \\n\\nMerck Group   \\n\\n2022 \\n\\n2022 \\nthereof: Merck KGaA \\n\\nTotal number of employees \\n\\n57,071   \\n\\n58,127   \\n\\n60,348   \\n\\nMen \\n\\nWomen \\n\\n32,531   \\n\\n33,204   \\n\\n34,274   \\n\\n24,540   \\n\\n24,923   \\n\\n26,074   \\n\\n64,243   \\n\\n36,452   \\n\\n27,791   \\n\\n8,485 \\n\\n5,510 \\n\\n2,975 \\n\\n1 Merck also has employees at sites that are not fully consolidated subsidiaries.

We regularly inform executives and employees about these behaviors through global campaigns. \\n\\nOur People Development and Learning Policy provides a Group-wide framework that guides employees in \\nmanaging their professional growth. It defines requirements for our development opportunities, roles and \\nresponsibilities. The associated processes are described in our People Development and Learning Standards. \\nOur flexible work guideline details our approach to evolving work environments and our aspiration to create a \\nmore agile organization. \\n\\nA competitive compensation structure \\n\\nWe reward the performance of our employees in order to maintain a competitive edge in attracting qualified \\nprofessionals. Within our Group, we base compensation on the requirements of each position and each \\nemployee’s respective performance. We make no distinctions based on gender or any other diversity criteria. \\n\\nTo ensure we maintain a competitive compensation structure, we regularly review our compensation policy \\nbased on data analyses and industry benchmarks. This enables us to compare internal factors and market \\nrequirements in equal measure. Before making changes to our compensation structure, we consult with key \\nstakeholders such as employee representatives. In 2022, we introduced a sustainability factor into our Long-\\nTerm Incentive Plan (LTIP). More information on the LTIP can be found in the Compensation report. \\n\\nStrengthening our sustainability culture \\n\\nWe launched two e-learning courses in order to strengthen the sustainability culture in our company. The first \\none is for employees and was already rolled out at the end of 2021. The second one has been available since \\nSeptember 2022 and is targeted to managers with personnel responsibility. The two courses are mandatory for \\nthe relevant employees and are available in nine and seven languages, respectively. As of the end of 2022, \\n83% of all employees had completed the training. \\n\\nDiversity, equity and inclusion \\n\\nWe are committed to promoting a strong sense of inclusion among our employees. Therefore, we approach \\ndiversity, equity & inclusion (DE&I) with the same purpose as our other global business objectives and \\naspirations. While we have always been a diverse organization – we currently span 66 countries and have over \\n64,000 employees from 139 nationalities – we recognize that our success depends on our ability to foster an \\nenvironment that champions equity and inclusion. In addition, our DE&I approach fuels our efforts to make \\npositive impacts in the communities where we live and work. We expect our leaders and managers to be \\nmindful and considerate in how they attract, hire, retain, and promote their people. We aim to help every \\nemployee maximize their potential, regardless of their gender identity, culture, ethnicity, race, religion or creed, \\nsexual orientation, nationality, socioeconomic and family status, language, disability status, age, mindset, \\nfaiths, military service, or political conviction. \\n\\nWe strive to create equitable outcomes and identify and eliminate any barriers that may hinder our employees’ \\ncontributions or their access to opportunities or career advancement. Ultimately, we believe diversity inspires \\nprogress and strengthens our ability to innovate in all areas of our business.  \\n\\n \\n \\n\\x0cCombined Management Report ___ Non-Financial Statement ___ Employee-related matters \\n\\n126  \\n\\nNumber of employees by hierarchical level1 \\n\\nAs of Dec. 31 \\n\\nTotal employees \\n\\n20192   \\n\\n2020   \\n\\n2021   \\n\\nMerck Group   \\n\\n2022 \\n\\n2022 \\nthereof: Merck KGaA \\n\\n57,071   \\n\\n58,127   \\n\\n60,348   \\n\\nSenior management (Role 6+) \\n\\n190   \\n\\n193   \\n\\n194   \\n\\nMiddle management (Role 4 & 5) \\n\\n3,352   \\n\\n3,637   \\n\\n3,831   \\n\\nLow management (Role 3) \\n\\n9,499   \\n\\n10,286   \\n\\n10,880   \\n\\nOther employees (below Role 3) \\n\\n44,030   \\n\\n44,011   \\n\\n45,443   \\n\\n% of women (total) \\n\\nthereof: in senior management (Role 6+) \\n\\nthereof: in middle management (Role 4 & 5)   \\n\\nthereof: in low management (Role 3) \\n\\n43   \\n\\n39   \\n\\n1,146   \\n\\n4,029   \\n\\n43   \\n\\n42   \\n\\n1,284   \\n\\n4,352   \\n\\n43   \\n\\n49   \\n\\n1,413   \\n\\n4,669   \\n\\nthereof: other employees (below Role 3) \\n\\n19,326   \\n\\n19,245   \\n\\n19,943   \\n\\n% of men (total) \\n\\nthereof: in senior management (Role 6+) \\n\\nthereof: in middle management (Role 4 & 5)   \\n\\nthereof: in low management (Role 3) \\n\\n57   \\n\\n151   \\n\\n2,206   \\n\\n5,470   \\n\\n57   \\n\\n151   \\n\\n2,353   \\n\\n5,934   \\n\\n57   \\n\\n145   \\n\\n2,418   \\n\\n6,211   \\n\\nthereof: other employees (below Role 3) \\n\\n24,704   \\n\\n24,766   \\n\\n25,500   \\n\\nby age group \\nUp to 29 years old (%) \\n\\nthereof: in senior management (Role 6+) \\n\\nthereof: in middle management (Role 4 & 5)   \\n\\n15   \\n\\n0   \\n\\n8   \\n\\n15   \\n\\n0   \\n\\n6   \\n\\n15   \\n\\n0   \\n\\n8   \\n\\nthereof: in low management (Role 3) \\n\\n190   \\n\\n199   \\n\\n241   \\n\\nthereof: other employees (below Role 3) \\n\\n8,362   \\n\\n8,365   \\n\\n8,880   \\n\\n30 to 49 years old (%) \\n\\nthereof: in senior management (Role 6+) \\n\\nthereof: in middle management (Role 4 & 5)   \\n\\nthereof: in low management (Role 3) \\n\\n60   \\n\\n69   \\n\\n1,933   \\n\\n6,516   \\n\\n60   \\n\\n68   \\n\\n2,032   \\n\\n6,926   \\n\\n60   \\n\\n63   \\n\\n2,172   \\n\\n7,298   \\n\\nthereof: other employees (below Role 3) \\n\\n25,859   \\n\\n25,948   \\n\\n26,624   \\n\\n50 years or older (%) \\n\\nthereof: in senior management (Role 6+) \\n\\nthereof: in middle management (Role 4 & 5)   \\n\\nthereof: in low management (Role 3) \\n\\nthereof: other employees (below Role 3) \\n\\n25   \\n\\n121   \\n\\n1,411   \\n\\n2,793   \\n\\n9,809   \\n\\n25   \\n\\n125   \\n\\n1,599   \\n\\n3,161   \\n\\n9,698   \\n\\n25   \\n\\n131   \\n\\n1,651   \\n\\n3,341   \\n\\n9,939   \\n\\n64,243   \\n\\n191   \\n\\n4,018   \\n\\n11,877   \\n\\n48,157   \\n\\n43   \\n\\n51   \\n\\n1,550   \\n\\n5,123   \\n\\n21,067   \\n\\n57   \\n\\n140   \\n\\n2,468   \\n\\n6,754   \\n\\n27,090   \\n\\n15   \\n\\n0   \\n\\n12   \\n\\n263   \\n\\n9,651   \\n\\n60   \\n\\n58   \\n\\n2,235   \\n\\n8,007   \\n\\n28,124   \\n\\n25   \\n\\n133   \\n\\n1,771   \\n\\n3,607   \\n\\n10,382   \\n\\n8,485 \\n\\n66 \\n\\n886 \\n\\n2,277 \\n\\n5,256 \\n\\n35 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n281 \\n\\n879 \\n\\n1,797 \\n\\n65 \\n\\n48 \\n\\n605 \\n\\n1,398 \\n\\n3,459 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n0 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n61 \\n\\n1,115 \\n\\n54 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n525 \\n\\n1,495 \\n\\n2,505 \\n\\n32 \\n\\n42 \\n\\n356 \\n\\n721 \\n\\n1,636 \\n\\n1 Merck also has employees at sites that are not fully consolidated subsidiaries.

In addition, we have established a centralized Diversity \\nCouncil consisting of high-ranking executives from all our business sectors and selected Group functions. \\n\\nOur commitment: Industry-wide initiatives and regulations \\n\\nOur Social and Labor Standards Policy categorically states that our company does not tolerate any form of \\ndiscrimination, physical or verbal harassment, or intolerance. To underscore our commitment to equality, \\nfairness, inclusion, and tolerance in the workplace, we also participate in industry-wide initiatives: \\n\\n•  Women’s Empowerment Principles \\n\\n• \\n\\nInclusion Action Plan of the German Mining, Chemical and Energy Industrial Union (IG BCE) \\n\\n•  Equal Opportunity Charter \\n\\n•  German Diversity Charter, Charta der Vielfalt e.

We created a network comprising our 18 major countries, \\nnominated dedicated representatives and developed tailored roadmaps for each country. We also streamlined \\nthe councils and working groups in the business sectors and major Group functions, renaming them Diversity, \\nInclusion, Community & Equity Councils. \\n\\nIn 2021, we pledged to our people, partners, patients, and industry to intensify our DE&I efforts and set robust \\naspirations to hold ourselves accountable. In 2022, we continued this strong focus and demonstrated that we \\nare on track to advance toward our 2030 goals. \\n\\nGender equity \\n\\nWe developed measures to achieve a more balanced gender structure at various hierarchical levels of our \\nbusiness. We are steadily making progress and have increased the share of women in leadership (roles 4+) to \\n38% (2021: 36%) while maintaining a stable 43% proportion of women in our global workforce. Building on \\nthis effort, we are aiming for gender parity in leadership positions by 2030. Moreover, we are committed to fair \\nand equitable pay for all employees. \\n\\nCulture and ethnicity \\n\\nWith 24% of our employees based in the United States, it is crucial that we become an employer of choice \\namong underrepresented racial and ethnic groups in this market. Therefore, we plan to increase the share of \\nemployees in U.S. leadership (roles 4+) who are members of underrepresented racial and ethnic groups from \\n21% to 30% by 2030. \\n\\nAdditionally, due to our current performance and future growth in Asia, Latin America and the Middle East and \\nAfrica (MEA), accounting for 40% of our Group sales, we aim to increase the global share of nationals from \\nAsia, Latin America, and MEA in leadership positions (roles 4+) from 16% to 30% by 2030. \\n\\nInclusion \\n\\nBeyond our aspiration to foster specific types of diversity and equity, we are accelerating our efforts to create a \\ngenuinely inclusive culture for all employees. To achieve this, we rolled out training courses to help leaders \\nreflect on how they can lead more inclusively. All leaders will be encouraged to complete these courses over the \\ncoming years. At the end of 2022, 64% (2021: 37%) of our leaders had participated in this training program. \\n\\nCommitted to fair and equitable pay \\n\\nOur commitment to pay equity is a critical aspect of our DE&I strategy. To create transparency around \\nunexplained pay gaps and identify their underlying root causes, we conducted a pay equity analysis in 2021 \\nwith a focus on gender-based discrepancies. In this first step, we analyzed ten of our largest countries, \\ncovering approximately 80% of our total employees. Based on this analysis, we continued to improve our \\ntransparency by releasing pay data publicly for the first time: The identified adjusted (unexplained) gender pay \\ngap is less than 1.5% in favor of men. While this is a good starting point and below the existing benchmark, we \\nwill continue to monitor pay data and take measured actions as needed. These include enabling our leaders to \\nensure we continue making equitable and unbiased pay decisions. \\n\\nEnsuring fair treatment for all \\n\\nWe do not tolerate any form of discrimination in our company, as stipulated with binding effect in our Code of \\nConduct and Social and Labor Standards Policy. In 2022, we published two new position papers on non-\\ndiscrimination and non-harassment, complementing our position paper on DE&I. In addition, we have \\nestablished various reporting channels to ensure employees have a clear point of contact should they \\nexperience harassment or discrimination in the workplace, or any other violations of our standards. Their first \\n\\n \\n \\n\\x0cCombined Management Report ___ Non-Financial Statement ___ Employee-related matters \\n\\n128  \\n\\npoints of contact are their supervisors, HR or compliance teams. Alternatively, employees can also make \\nanonymous calls to our compliance hotline. In 2022, 20 alleged cases of discrimination were reported via the \\ncompliance hotline and other channels, seven incidents were confirmed. \\n\\nHealth and safety \\n\\nWe seek to promote the health and well-being of our employees and sustain their long-term performance \\nability, which in turn necessitates a safe workplace. We are therefore constantly working to further strengthen \\nour health and safety culture.  \\n\\nThe lost time injury rate (LTIR) is the indicator used to gauge the success of our occupational safety efforts. It \\nis a global measure of the number of accidents resulting in at least one day of missed work per one million \\nhours worked. We determine the Group-wide LTIR both for our employees and supervised temporary staff. Our \\nobjective is to lower LTIR to below 1.0 by 2025. \\n\\nGenerally, before starting an activity anywhere in the world, we perform a hazard assessment to identify risks \\nand do everything possible to eliminate them before commencing the activity or commissioning a plant. If this \\nis not feasible, we put measures in place to minimize the likelihood of risks and their potential impacts. Hazard \\nassessments are the responsibility of our individual sites and are therefore conducted by them. \\n\\nSince the start of 2022, we have been developing a Group-wide health strategy for our employees to enable \\nthem to maintain and promote their health. \\n\\nRoles and responsibilities \\n\\nOur EHS (Environment, Health and Safety) management system is the responsibility of Corporate \\nSustainability, Quality and Trade Compliance, which in turn reports to the Chair of the Executive Board. This \\nGroup function sets objectives, oversees the respective initiatives globally and conducts internal EHS audits. \\nLocal EHS managers and their teams ensure that our individual sites comply with all occupational health and \\nsafety laws and regulations. They are also responsible for local projects, campaigns and programs. \\n\\nEmployees concerned about their health or safety are permitted to temporarily step back from their work until \\nthe issue has been resolved. Globally, across the Group, they are encouraged to report such concerns via our \\ncompliance hotline. \\n\\nOur commitment: Standards and policies \\n\\nOur Corporate EHS Policy (Corporate Environment, Health and Safety Policy) describes our fundamental \\napproach to occupational health and safety. It is an integral part of our EHS management system and \\nundergoes an external ISO 45001 audit every year. As part of a Group certificate, our occupational health and \\nsafety management system was ISO 45001-certified at 61 sites at the end of 2022. \\n\\nOur Group-wide Health Policy specifies our approach to ensuring workplace safety for our employees while also \\npromoting their health and well-being. In this policy, we set out our Group-wide approach to health and safety \\nmanagement, which is aimed at preventing workplace accidents and occupational illnesses. \\n\\nIt is our aim to ensure that environmental, health and safety aspects are also respected in our partnerships \\nwith contractors throughout the entire relationship, from starting a job to completion. This objective is reflected \\nin our Contractor EHS Management Standard. \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cCombined Management Report ___ Non-Financial Statement ___ Employee-related matters \\n\\n129  \\n\\nAccident rates \\n\\nOur employees are required to immediately report any relevant occupational accidents to Corporate \\nSustainability, Quality and Trade Compliance, where the incidents are assessed. If necessary, we then \\nimplement additional safety measures at our sites. This procedure is now practiced across all of our production \\nfacilities around the world. We track the following occupational safety data across our sites worldwide: \\n\\n•  The LTIR measures the accidents resulting in at least one day of missed work per one million hours worked. \\n\\nIn 2022, our LTIR of 1.2 remained unchanged in comparison with the previous year. The majority of \\nincidents resulting in lost time were slips, trips and falls, along with contusions and lacerations from the \\noperation of machinery and equipment. Once more, in 2022, we recorded no fatal accidents. \\n\\n•  We use our Environment, Health and Safety Incident Rate (EHS IR) to track accidents. \\n\\n•  Alongside this indicator, in the United States we also use the Occupational Illness Rate to monitor work-\\n\\nrelated illnesses and their long-term effects. \\n\\nWork-related accidents1 \\n\\n2019   \\n\\n2020   \\n\\n2021   \\n\\nMerck Group   \\n\\n2022 \\n\\n2022 \\nthereof: Merck KGaA \\n\\nLost Time Injury Rate (LTIR = workplace \\naccidents resulting in missed days of work \\nper one million hours worked) \\n\\n1.6   \\n\\n1.3   \\n\\n1.2   \\n\\nby region \\n\\nEurope \\n\\nNorth America \\n\\nAsia-Pacific (APAC) \\n\\nLatin America \\n\\nMiddle East and Africa (MEA) \\n\\nNumber of deaths \\n\\nby region \\n\\nEurope \\n\\nNorth America \\n\\nAsia-Pacific (APAC) \\n\\nLatin America \\n\\nMiddle East and Africa (MEA) \\n\\nby gender \\n\\nWomen \\n\\nMen \\n\\n1 Including supervised temporary staff \\n\\n2.6   \\n\\n1.0   \\n\\n0.2   \\n\\n1.7   \\n\\n0.0   \\n\\n0   \\n\\n0   \\n\\n0   \\n\\n0   \\n\\n0   \\n\\n0   \\n\\n0   \\n\\n0   \\n\\n2.4   \\n\\n0.8   \\n\\n0.1   \\n\\n0.8   \\n\\n0.4   \\n\\n0   \\n\\n0   \\n\\n0   \\n\\n0   \\n\\n0   \\n\\n0   \\n\\n0   \\n\\n0   \\n\\n2.1   \\n\\n1.2   \\n\\n0.1   \\n\\n0.4   \\n\\n0.0   \\n\\n0   \\n\\n0   \\n\\n0   \\n\\n0   \\n\\n0   \\n\\n0   \\n\\n0   \\n\\n0   \\n\\n1.2   \\n\\n1.7   \\n\\n1.7   \\n\\n0.3   \\n\\n0.6   \\n\\n1.1   \\n\\n0   \\n\\n0   \\n\\n0   \\n\\n0   \\n\\n0   \\n\\n0   \\n\\n0   \\n\\n0   \\n\\n2 \\n\\n2 \\n\\nnot applicable \\n\\nnot applicable \\n\\nnot applicable \\n\\nnot applicable \\n\\n0 \\n\\n0 \\n\\nnot applicable \\n\\nnot applicable \\n\\nnot applicable \\n\\nnot applicable \\n\\n0 \\n\\n0 \\n\\nA work-related accident is an injury that results from the type of work, in the course of doing said work, and that has no internal cause. Work-related \\naccidents are considered relevant if they occur on the premises, on business trips, during goods transport, as a result of external influences (e.g. natural \\ndisasters), or due to criminal acts involving personal injury. Commuting accidents and accidents during company sporting activities are not included. First-aid \\nincidents are generally not included in the LTIR since these usually do not result in more than one day of missed work. \\n\\nClear rules of conduct \\n\\nGroup-wide, all new EHS managers must complete a three-day EHS onboarding that covers topics such as \\noccupational health and safety as well as our BeSafe! safety culture program. Through this initiative, we raise \\nemployee awareness of occupational hazards and teach them rules for safe behavior. In addition, we regularly \\nprovide occupational safety training at our sites covering both legal requirements as well as the specific local \\nrisks.\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cCombined Management Report ___ Non-Financial Statement ___ Social matters and respect for human rights \\n\\n130  \\n\\nSocial matters and respect for human rights \\n\\nResponsible supply chain \\n\\nWith our supplier management endeavors, we aim for compliance with fundamental environmental and social \\nstandards in addition to high quality, reliable delivery and competitive prices. Therefore, we have introduced \\nrelevant strategies, processes and guidelines to prevent violations of supply chain standards and continuously \\nimproving our sustainability performance. Unless stated otherwise, the approaches presented apply to direct \\nsuppliers. Furthermore, our supplier management activities include special measures particularly for indirect \\nsuppliers working in the area of conflict minerals. \\n\\nTo achieve our sustainability goals, our Group Procurement team is working closely with our suppliers. We aim \\nto create transparency in all our sourcing regions and fully integrate sustainability into all our value chains. To \\nthis end, we have defined two key indicators to measure our journey towards increasing this transparency by \\nevaluating the sustainability performance of our relevant suppliers with valid sustainability assessments. Our \\ndefinition of valid sustainability assessment includes assessments carried out over the last three years and \\nperformed by a reliable, approved source. Relevant suppliers either indicate a specific country and industry risk \\nor contribute to a significant percentage of our supplier spend (at least 50%). For the risk evaluation, we \\npreviously used the risk data provided by EcoVadis. For the country risk, we have developed our own more \\ncomprehensive country risk score in 2022.  \\n\\nIn 2022, 46% (2021: 33%) of our relevant suppliers were covered by a valid sustainability assessment; 82% \\n(2021: 74%) of our spend generated from these suppliers were covered by suppliers with a valid sustainability \\nassessment. To achieve comparability of our key indicators over the years, we applied this new country risk \\nscore also retrospectively for 2021 data, the starting point of our measurement. \\n\\nWe consider all applicable legal requirements and initiate corresponding measures where necessary. For this \\npurpose, in 2022, we implemented measures to operate compliant with German Supply Chain Due Diligence \\nAct. Among other things, the Head of Corporate Sustainability, Quality and Trade Compliance has been \\nappointed as Human Rights Officer. \\n\\nOur Supplier Decarbonization Program is a key element of achieving our Science Based Target. Through the \\nprogram, we aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions associated with purchased goods and services as well as \\ncapital goods. \\n\\nRisk management process \\n\\nTo ensure security of supply, we select our suppliers based on criteria such as country risk, material risk, \\nsupplier risk, and their strategic importance to the business. This process helps our sourcing managers identify \\npotential mitigation actions with relevant suppliers and supports them in making improvements. The approach \\ntowards our strategic suppliers which account for approximately 49% of our total supplier spend includes the \\nidentification, monitoring and assessment of supply security risks. It comprises four main elements: \\n\\n•  Supplier Risk Assessments: to capture the overarching risks at the supplier level, considering multiple risk \\n\\ndomains. \\n\\n•  Alert system: to notify our Procurement organization about risk events arising with any of our suppliers. \\n\\n•  Material Risk Assessments: to identify and mitigate the risks of the materials used in our most significant \\n\\nfinished products. \\n\\n•  Risk Response Tracker: a system to create and monitor risk mitigation activities in inter-disciplinary teams. \\n\\n \\n \\n\\x0cCombined Management Report ___ Non-Financial Statement ___ Social matters and respect for human rights \\n\\n131  \\n\\nWe calculate risk factors for suppliers and raw materials by multiplying risk probability and risk impact. We \\nhave simplified our risk methodology to focus on the ten most relevant risk categories - including but not \\nlimited to economic freedom, social unrest, unfair business practices, and poor labor practices - grouped into \\nthree risk domains. We also include criteria for identifying supplier relationships impacted by key sustainability \\nrisks, such as mineral sourcing and animal welfare. \\n\\nDue diligence process for responsible sourcing of minerals \\n\\nWe source and sell products that contain minerals commonly referred to as “3TG” (tin, tungsten, tantalum, \\ngold – collectively also known as conflict minerals). These minerals involve the risk of being extracted, traded, \\nhandled, and exported from conflict-affected and high-risk areas where human rights are not always respected \\nand violations thereof need to be prevented. \\n\\nOur aim is to source materials in a responsible and conflict-free manner and not to contribute to adverse \\nimpacts through our activities. Therefore, we have a due diligence program that applies across all our business \\nsectors and is in line with applicable laws and international standards. \\n\\nIn order to continuously improve our due diligence practices, we have a system to store and maintain supplier \\ninformation across our business sectors. This system supports increased transparency of our supply chain. In \\naddition, we are working on the integration of further control mechanisms into our due diligence framework for \\nhigh-risk suppliers.  \\n\\nRoles and responsibilities \\n\\nGroup Procurement is responsible for integrating sustainability requirements into the relevant stages of our \\nsourcing and supplier management processes. Our Center of Excellence for Supply Security coordinates the \\nrelevant measures, such as updating our guidelines where necessary, examining processes and coordinating \\nour participation in external initiatives. \\n\\nOur commitment: Guidelines and standards \\n\\nWe expect all our suppliers and service providers to comply with our environmental and social standards, which \\nare primarily derived from the core labor standards of the International Labour Organization (ILO) and the UN \\nGlobal Compact. We expect our suppliers to ensure that their subcontractors respect the same rules. In the \\nreporting year, we have developed a Supplier Code of Conduct which details our expectations towards \\nsuppliers and business partners regarding human rights, health and safety, business integrity, environmental \\nprotection, continuous improvement, and management of their respective suppliers more comprehensively. It \\nreplaces our Responsible Sourcing Principles as of January 2023. \\n\\nOur Responsible Minerals Sourcing Charter demonstrates our commitment to responsible sourcing of minerals \\nfrom conflict-affected and high-risk areas. It applies to all our legal entities and subsidiaries worldwide. The \\ncharter complements the requirements set out in our Supplier Code of Conduct. \\n\\nTo ensure that we work based on industry standards and can rely on comparable data analytics and expert \\nanalysis, we collaborate with our peer companies in industry initiatives. For example, we are a member of \\nTogether for Sustainability (TfS), the Pharma Supply Chain Initiative (PSCI), the Responsible Mica Initiative, \\nand the Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI). We call on our suppliers to let us or trusted partners conduct \\nassessments or audits to increase our supply chain transparency and identify fields of activity to improve \\nsustainability performance or mitigate infringement risks.  \\n\\nTogether for Sustainability supplier assessments and audits \\n\\nThrough the TfS initiative, suppliers are assessed either based on information obtained during audits or based \\non self-reported and publicly accessible information provided by EcoVadis, an independent rating agency. \\nEcoVadis assesses suppliers from more than 160 countries and 200 sectors across the four categories of \\n\\n \\n \\n\\x0cCombined Management Report ___ Non-Financial Statement ___ Social matters and respect for human rights \\n\\n132  \\n\\nEnvironment, Labor and Human Rights, Ethics, and Sustainable Procurement. On top of the assessments, \\nsuppliers are also monitored through a 360-degree news watch. The results are shared among TfS member \\ncompanies in compliance with all restrictions stipulated by antitrust law. \\n\\nThrough the TfS initiative alone, we have access to more than 1,700 valid scorecards on the assessment of our \\nsuppliers, more than 1,100 of which completed a new assessment or re-assessment in 2022. In some cases, \\nthese were initiated by us and in other cases by other TfS members. \\n\\nMica supply chain \\n\\nMica is an important raw material for our effect pigments, which are used in automotive, cosmetic and industrial \\ncoatings as well as plastics. We procure the majority of our mica from the Indian states of Jharkhand and Bihar. \\nWe have special measures in place to comply with high social and environmental standards in our mica supply \\nchain. By procuring mica from the Indian states of Jharkhand and Bihar, where social and economic factors \\ncontribute to poor working conditions, including child labor, we are supporting this region by safeguarding local \\nemployment and livelihoods. We source the raw material only from suppliers operating in formal working \\nenvironments and we monitor compliance with our standards, including the prohibition of child labor. \\n\\nOur mica suppliers are informed of our standards and have confirmed that they adhere to the principles of our \\nHuman Rights Charter as well as the requirements of our Supplier Code of Conduct (formerly Responsible \\nSourcing Principles). In the event of non-compliance with our standards, we work with suppliers to ensure the \\nappropriate implementation of corrective measures. \\n\\nWe do not tolerate child labor and contractually prohibit our suppliers from employing children. If one of our \\nsuppliers were found to be using child labor, Merck would terminate the business relationship immediately. We \\nare driving initiatives and taking measures to improve the conditions of mica sourcing based on our high \\nstandards. We continuously review our monitoring processes to improve their effectiveness. \\n\\nAuditing our mica supply chain \\n\\nWe have implemented a series of oversight mechanisms using a system that monitors and audits conformity \\nwith our social and environmental standards. In addition to visits by our company’s employees, regular \\ninspections are conducted by third parties, who conduct comprehensive announced audits as well as frequent, \\nunannounced verification visits. \\n\\nEnvironmental Resources Management (ERM), a leading global provider of environmental, health, safety, risk, \\nand social consulting services, conducts external audits of mines and processing plants, investigating working \\nconditions as well as environmental, health and safety issues. The audit reports document any identified \\nshortcomings in this respect and propose corrective actions. Findings concerning the ventilation of workplaces \\nand fire prevention were successfully addressed. Our employees in Kolkata (India) and Darmstadt (Germany) \\ntake action to address any identified issues. If the corrective measures are not respected, we may suspend or \\neven terminate our business relationship. \\n\\nSince 2013, IGEP Consult, an Indian non-governmental organization, has conducted regular unannounced \\ninspections to review labor standards throughout our supply chain. During these visits, IGEP officials monitor \\noccupational safety and compliance with laws preventing child labor. In 2022, its inspections focused on \\nchecking the availability of physical examinations for workers and conducting mock fire drills. Additionally, we \\nregularly optimize the escalation process together with IGEP, which holds bi-weekly review meetings with \\nrepresentatives of our company to assess suppliers. These meetings help to identify any required actions, which \\nour sourcing teams then discuss and implement with our suppliers. As a result, our suppliers have successfully \\nimproved the working conditions at these sites. \\n\\n \\n \\n\\x0cCombined Management Report ___ Non-Financial Statement ___ Social matters and respect for human rights \\n\\n133  \\n\\nEvaluating and tracking mica sources \\n\\nWe use a tracking system to help ensure that the mica we purchase is derived from sources qualified by our \\ncompany. We also use this tracking system to monitor productivity of our mica sources. Based on written \\nrecords of the daily extraction quantities, we review the volumes of mica reported and supplied to the \\nprocessing facilities. Furthermore, we use a digital traceability solution to increase transparency in the mica \\nsupply chain.  \\n\\nTo maintain accuracy, our processes undergo constant review and improvement. We are also evaluating other \\nmica sources in accordance with our quality, social and environmental standards, both in India and other \\nregions. For example, in 2022, we sourced a considerable amount of mica in Brazil, where we have also \\nestablished oversight mechanisms to monitor and audit adherence to these standards. \\n\\nHuman rights \\n\\nWe are committed to upholding human rights, which is why we became a signatory to the UN Global Compact \\nback in 2005. We endeavor to prevent the risk of human rights violations as far as possible, not only at our own \\nsites but also along our entire supply chain. That is why we integrate human rights due diligence into our \\nbusiness processes.  \\n\\nWe view our human rights due diligence as a continuous process, which we constantly adapt and improve. This \\nalso prompts us to continually review our approach. We closely monitor regulatory developments – for \\nexample, the planned EU directive on human rights due diligence. \\n\\nRoles and responsibilities \\n\\nOur Executive Board has ultimate responsibility for human rights within our sphere of influence. The Executive \\nBoard exercises this responsibility by requiring our Managing Directors to respect human rights. \\n\\nOur Group Corporate Sustainability unit is responsible for coordinating all human rights due diligence activities \\nacross the Group. The persons responsible for these issues in the respective Group functions, business sectors \\nand local units implement the specific measures, for instance by integrating human rights due diligence into \\nexisting processes. \\n\\nOur commitment: Guiding principles, charters and laws \\n\\nOur Human Rights Charter aligns with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. It is our \\noverarching human rights governance document and defines the relevant requirements for our company. We \\nexpect our employees as well as our suppliers and all companies with which we have business ties to comply \\nwith this charter.  \\n\\nIn 2022, we further developed our existing approach to human rights due diligence, prompted by the specific \\nrequirements of the new German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act. Among other things, we appointed the Head \\nof Corporate Sustainability, Quality and Trade Compliance as human rights officer to monitor compliance with \\nhuman rights due diligence requirements and the implementation of processes throughout the Group in the \\nfuture. \\n\\nIdentifying actual and potential impacts on human rights \\n\\nWe perform risk assessments to understand the potential impacts our operations and business relationships \\ncould have on human rights. For instance, we investigate human rights risks at our sites as well as risks related \\nto product and service sourcing. These risk assessments enable us to derive the corresponding strategies and \\nmeasures. We track human rights risks through our strategic supplier risk process. More information on how we \\nengage with suppliers can be found under Responsible supply chain. \\n\\n \\n \\n\\x0cCombined Management Report ___ Non-Financial Statement ___ Social matters and respect for human rights \\n\\n134  \\n\\nWe also meet our human rights due diligence obligations when deploying new technologies. Our Code of Digital \\nEthics defines digital ethics principles and forms the basis for the work of the Digital Ethics Advisory Panel. \\nMore information can be found under Digital ethics. \\n\\nAuditing our suppliers and sites \\n\\nOur Global Social and Labor Standards Policy stipulates the social and labor standards at our sites. We \\nregularly check compliance with the requirements using a risk-based approach. Among other things, this takes \\ninto account risks that may arise if relevant laws and regulations change or if there are violations of \\ninternationally recognized labor rights by governments and companies, as assessed by the International Trade \\nUnion Confederation and documented in the annual ITUC Global Rights Index. If we identify a violation during \\nthe audit, we define remedial actions together with the responsible Managing Director and/or local HR staff. \\n\\nIn addition, we review human rights aspects at our sites through security audits. The audits are one control \\nmechanism of our security governance framework. Increased risk transparency and centralized CAPA tracking \\nallows us to ensure that our sites meet security-relevant human rights aspects. \\n\\nThrough the Together for Sustainability (TfS) initiative, we determine whether our strategically important \\nsuppliers comply with human rights standards. \\n\\nCreating awareness among our employees \\n\\nTo train our Managing Directors and senior management, we offer an e-learning course on implementing the \\nrequirements of our Social and Labor Standards Policy in their areas of responsibility. Our onboarding training \\nfor all new EHS managers continues to cover the topic of human rights, with a particular focus on the issue of \\nmodern slavery. In addition, the Supervisory Board received training on the requirements and implementation \\nof the new German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act in 2022. \\n\\nOur reporting practices \\n\\nWe inform the public about our approaches, measures and results of human rights due diligence. We provide \\ninformation on this annually in our Sustainability Report. Additionally, legislation in Australia and the United \\nKingdom requires us to publish the steps we are taking to counter forced labor and human trafficking. Apart \\nfrom the UK Modern Slavery Statement, we also published our first Merck Australia Modern Slavery \\nStatement in 2022. Both have been signed by the Chair of the Executive Board and published on our website. \\n\\nOur complaint mechanism \\n\\nOur compliance hotline is the most important channel for reporting complaints about potential human rights \\nviolations. Our employees as well as external stakeholders can report suspected cases via this Group-wide \\nwhistleblowing system in their respective national language, free of charge and anonymously, either by \\ntelephone or a web-based application. We thoroughly investigate all complaints that we receive and take \\ncountermeasures if necessary. More information on the compliance hotline can be found under Compliance \\nmanagement. \\n\\nIn 2022, there were no indications from our compliance hotline of child or forced labor or violations of the right \\nto collective bargaining or freedom of association within our own global business operations. Regarding forced \\nlabor, we were informed that we offered rubber gloves for which a manufacturer is accused of labor abuses \\nincluding forced labor in Malaysia. The matter is being investigated further. Our supplier has already terminated \\nbusiness relations with the manufacturer. Consequently, our company also no longer has any business ties to \\nthe manufacturer in the affected supply chain. \\n\\n \\n \\n\\x0cCombined Management Report ___ Non-Financial Statement ___ Social matters and respect for human rights \\n\\n135  \\n\\nHuman rights violations1 \\n\\nNumber of reported violations of Social and Labor Standards \\nPolicy \\n\\nNumber of confirmed Violations of Social and Labor Standards \\nPolicy \\n\\nthereof: number of incidents of discrimination \\n\\n20192   \\n\\n2020   \\n\\n2021   \\n\\n2022 \\n\\n-   \\n\\n-   \\n\\n-   \\n\\n108   \\n\\n121   \\n\\n136 \\n\\n29   \\n\\n2   \\n\\n41   \\n\\n6   \\n\\n68 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n1 In 2020, we modified our reporting structure for human rights violations. Previously, we reported on such violations in the “ Reported compliance \\n\\nviolations” table. Since 2020, we report on violations of our Social and Labor Standards Policy, which was implemented across the entire Group in 2019. \\n\\n2 Due to our revised reporting practices, we have decided not to report the data from previous years. \\n\\nPatient safety \\n\\nThrough a rigorous benefit-risk management process, we help to ensure that the benefits of our medicinal \\nproducts always outweigh the risks for patients. Every new medicine goes through a series of precisely defined \\ndevelopment stages. Before any medicinal product is administered to human subjects, we conduct extensive \\npreclinical testing both in vitro and in vivo. \\n\\nDuring clinical development, we diligently use all the collected data to continuously evaluate the medicinal \\nproduct’s benefit-risk profile. If we consider the medicinal product’s benefit-risk profile to be positive, we then \\nsubmit an application for marketing authorization to the relevant regulatory authorities. \\n\\nContinual monitoring of product safety risk profiles \\n\\nOnce we launch a new medicinal product, the number of patients being treated with the product increases \\nsignificantly. In rare circumstances, there may be adverse and potentially serious effects that were not detected \\nduring clinical development, which is why we continuously monitor risks and assess the benefit-risk profiles of \\nthe products after their market launch. Pharmacovigilance includes the process of monitoring a medicinal \\nproduct on an ongoing basis to detect and assess safety signals as part of signal management activities. Our \\npharmacovigilance system and our pharmacovigilance business continuity management ensure continuous \\nmonitoring of adverse effects, allowing us to proactively and transparently minimize and communicate any \\nrisks. Emergency response procedures for business continuity are managed in accordance with global and local \\nbusiness continuity plans, tested in regular, defined intervals or with mock scenarios. In addition, we always \\nprovide healthcare professionals and patients with the latest information on the safety of all our marketed \\nmedicinal products. The scope of continuous safety monitoring includes the entire life cycle of a product, \\nranging from development, market launch and commercialization to expiration of the marketing authorization. \\n\\nRoles and responsibilities \\n\\nOur Global Patient Safety unit is responsible for pharmacovigilance. It continuously collects current safety data \\nfrom a wide variety of sources across the globe, including clinical studies, early access programs, spontaneous \\nreports on adverse effects, patient support programs, and articles published in medical and scientific journals. \\nOur vision is to embed a deep knowledge of safety into early decision-making as we evolve to practice \\npredictive safety. \\n\\nOur experts help to ensure that all information on the risks and adverse effects of our medical products is \\nproperly documented, tracked and reported to the respective health authorities in accordance with regulatory \\nrequirements. Our Global Patient Safety unit analyzes all data and reassesses the benefit-risk profile based on \\nthese data, where required. We then inform regulatory authorities, healthcare professionals and patients about \\nnew risks, additional risk mitigation measures and potential changes in the benefit-risk profile. \\n\\nOur Global Patient Safety unit hosts a Pharmacovigilance Intelligence Council that focuses on changes in \\npharmacovigilance legislation and its impacts on our global and local pharmacovigilance systems. This initiative \\nenables us to make strategic decisions and govern changes in pharmacovigilance requirements, which fosters \\nour target to ensure continuous compliance with regulatory requirements. \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cCombined Management Report ___ Non-Financial Statement ___ Social matters and respect for human rights \\n\\n136  \\n\\nOur Medical Safety and Ethics Board \\n\\nOur Medical Safety and Ethics Board (MSEB) oversees the safety and benefit-risk assessments of our medicinal \\nproducts throughout their clinical development and commercialization. This internal board is chaired by our \\nChief Medical Officer and comprises experienced physicians, scientists and experts from our company. \\nThroughout a medicinal product’s entire life cycle, the MSEB reviews and assesses important medical safety \\nrisks and benefit-risk issues and endorses appropriate measures to minimize risks, such as updates to product \\ninformation. The MSEB furthermore reviews human-related ethical issues as appropriate. \\n\\nOur commitment: Guidelines and statutory requirements \\n\\nOur aim is to follow international guidance and standard procedures, such as the International Council for \\nHarmonisation (ICH) guidelines and the Good Pharmacovigilance Practices (GVP) established by the European \\nMedicines Agency (EMA) and national health authorities. Furthermore, we aim at complying with all new \\nstatutory pharmacovigilance regulations in the countries where we market our products. \\n\\nInspections and audits for drug safety monitoring \\n\\nRegulatory authorities conduct periodic inspections to verify that we comply with statutory requirements as well \\nas our own internal pharmacovigilance standards. We follow up on the findings of health authority inspections \\nand take necessary actions to ensure the ongoing compliance of our pharmacovigilance system. In 2022, we \\nhad four pharmacovigilance inspections. \\n\\nFurthermore, we perform audits to ensure that all our units and subsidiaries involved in pharmacovigilance \\nconsistently meet all global requirements. In 2022, we conducted a total of 19 pharmacovigilance audits and \\nfound no significant deviations in our pharmacovigilance systems from these requirements and standards. We \\nalso conducted 16 external audits at our vendors and licensing partners involved in pharmacovigilance, helping \\nus improve our pharmacovigilance processes and comply with regulatory requirements. \\n\\nApplying our proactive safety strategy to benefit-risk assessments \\n\\nWith regard to product safety risk assessments, we have implemented an improved benefit-risk management \\nstrategy in order to become a proactive and benefit-risk-focused organization. In this context, we developed in \\n2021 the concepts and principles for conducting benefit-risk assessments at each stage of product development \\nand post-marketing. Along with the implementation of the redesigned benefit-risk strategy, the new Benefit \\nRisk Action Team co-leadership model was rolled out in 2022. This redesigned approach will enable us to \\nunderstand in even greater detail the benefit-risk profiles of our products, enabling early decision-making within \\nthe organization to protect patient safety. Ultimately, the aim is to be able to provide the right medicine to the \\nright patient at the right time. \\n\\nUp-to-date labeling and product information \\n\\nOur product information explains to healthcare professionals and patients how to correctly use the respective \\nproduct and make informed treatment decisions. We review and update all product information documents, \\nsuch as package leaflets, to ensure our medicinal products contain the latest information on safety, efficacy and \\npharmaceutical formulation. In accordance with regulatory requirements, we submit all modifications to our \\nleaflets to the respective regulatory authorities for approval. In 2022, there were no significant reportable \\nincidents of non-compliance with regulations concerning the labeling of our medicinal products. \\n\\nInternal and external training \\n\\nOur pharmacovigilance experts are regularly trained so that they gain and maintain the required experience \\nand knowledge to carry out their activities. We manage our training via a global learning platform and verify \\ncompliance with our training requirements by producing training completion reports. \\n\\n \\n \\n\\x0cCombined Management Report ___ Non-Financial Statement ___ Social matters and respect for human rights \\n\\n137  \\n\\nOur approximately 24,000 Healthcare employees receive basic pharmacovigilance training once a year that \\ncovers the procedure for reporting adverse effects or special circumstances associated with the use of our \\nproducts. \\n\\nPrices of medicines \\n\\nTo help ensure that all patients have access to the most effective medicines for their needs, we are working to \\nprevent cost from becoming a barrier to treatment. Therefore, we adapt our medicine prices according to \\npeople’s ability to pay in different geographic and socioeconomic segments. \\n\\nWe are committed to fair, flexible and sustainable pricing – both within and across countries. We therefore \\nadapt our prices based on local market considerations, such as unmet medical and treatment needs, health \\nsystem capacity, infrastructure and socioeconomic standards. This approach involves working closely with \\ngovernments and other stakeholders. In addition, we continuously monitor dynamic healthcare environments \\nand markets, pricing and reimbursement systems as well as legal and regulatory guidelines, adjusting our \\nprices as necessary. \\n\\nWe conduct price analyses annually to validate price thresholds and provide guidance on local pricing to our \\nsubsidiaries for the following year. The aim is to ensure they meet patient access needs, taking a consistent, \\ndata-driven approach. We also make our products affordable to patients in low- and middle-income countries \\nwith an equitable value and access strategy that includes participating in government tenders, providing flexible \\npricing, establishing high-quality affordable brands or branded generics and operating patient access programs. \\n\\nFurthermore, we support innovative risk-sharing agreements and are working to improve data efficiency in \\nhealth systems in order to achieve an optimal distribution of funds and resources. \\n\\nRoles and responsibilities \\n\\nOur Global Market Access and Pricing (GMAP) unit evaluates market launch prices in coordination with the \\nrespective franchises. The team reports directly to a member of our Healthcare Executive Committee. The \\nGMAP unit systematically evaluates our medicine portfolios and applies equal access initiatives to them. Our \\nlocal affiliates are responsible for managing prices and adapting them to evolving local conditions in compliance \\nwith our pricing governance and the defined price approval process. \\n\\nOur commitment: Medicine price guidelines and principles \\n\\nThe affordability of our health solutions is part of our broader patient value proposition. Our medicine pricing \\nadheres to the stipulations of our overarching Access to Health Charter and is defined in detail in an internal \\nguideline. Additionally, our Patient Access Programs Policy sets out standards for offering medicines at \\naffordable prices. \\n\\nValue-based contracting models \\n\\nWe are committed to advancing value-based healthcare through pricing and contracting mechanisms that fully \\ncomply with all applicable local laws and regulations. In collaboration with payers, such as health insurance \\ncompanies, we have developed various product- and market-specific reimbursement and contracting models. \\nThese help to provide patients with prompt access to our innovations. In addition, we aim to pilot outcome-\\nbased contracting models in one or two markets for our Fertility product portfolio in 2023. \\n\\nEquitable value and access approaches to serve low- and middle-income patients \\n\\nWe work in close partnership with governments and other stakeholders on innovative, differential medicine \\npricing schemes. In addition, we supply products at affordable prices to certain countries in Africa, Asia, Latin \\nAmerica, and the Middle East. \\n\\n \\n \\n\\x0cCombined Management Report ___ Non-Financial Statement ___ Social matters and respect for human rights \\n\\n138  \\n\\nOur pharmaceutical tender excellence initiative offers a strategic tender framework. This includes a web-based \\nsystem that helps country teams increase quality and agility in tender decisions, while improving performance \\ntracking and collaboration. \\n\\nFor some of our existing high-quality products, we have created second brands at affordable prices, particularly \\nin countries with a large percentage of patients with very low incomes. We operate patient access programs \\nthat enable us to offer certain products at affordable prices in several countries. \\n\\nClinical studies \\n\\nOur aim is to conduct high-caliber clinical research that always is in compliance with applicable laws and \\nregulations. As a responsible company, we set Group wide requirements to ensure that the highest ethical and \\nscientific standards worldwide are met when conducting clinical trials. \\n\\nWe only conduct clinical studies to investigate issues that are relevant to patients, healthcare professionals or \\nsociety, and only when the medicines being tested show significant therapeutic promise and have a positive \\nbenefit-risk ratio. In addition, a sound, established scientific methodology must be available to investigate \\nthese scientific or medical questions. We only enroll the specific number of participants required to answer each \\nof these questions. \\n\\nProtecting the safety, well-being, dignity and rights of the patients and healthy volunteers participating in our \\nclinical studies is of utmost importance to us. We do not intentionally expose study participants to undue risk or \\nirreversible harm. Personal data privacy is also very important to us, and we maintain a strong focus on data \\nprotection and confidentiality in compliance with statutory regulations. \\n\\nBased on our Standard on Human Research we aim to design and plan our studies to ensure that diverse \\npatient populations who are expected to use a product when approved are adequately represented. Study \\nparticipants shall not be discriminated against due to e.g. gender, ethnic origin, religion, disabilities, sexual \\norientation or socio-economic status. \\n\\nPatient-focused drug development \\n\\nWe are improving our approach to research and development by committing to patient-focused drug \\ndevelopment that more actively involves patients, caregivers, and their advocates in our work. Their valuable \\ninsights into disease and treatment management will help us make more informed decisions at each stage of \\nthe medicine development process. We aim to make our studies easy for patients to understand while ensuring \\nall participants have positive experiences as they contribute to our understanding of the particular disease and \\nits treatment. At every level of our organization, we are additionally educating staff about the value of a close, \\nmore consistent patient interaction and the requirements to protect our patients’ independence and privacy. \\n\\nWe conduct all our clinical studies in accordance with local laws and regulations, and we adhere to all relevant \\ninternational scientific and ethical standards, irrespective of the region or country. \\n\\nRoles and responsibilities \\n\\nClinical drug development, including clinical studies and the related governance process, are the responsibility \\nof our Global Development unit. The Head of Global Research & Development reports to the CEO Healthcare, \\nwho is a member of the Executive Board. \\n\\nWe have established two internal committees to oversee our clinical studies. The Integrated Protocol Review \\nCommittee is responsible for the studies performed by the company on medicines that are under clinical \\ndevelopment, while the Global Medical Decision Board is responsible for our own studies with approved \\nmedicines, as well as for all studies performed by independent investigators and supported by us (so-called \\ninvestigator-sponsored studies). Both bodies consist of medical-scientific experts and executives with long-\\nstanding experience in clinical research. \\n\\n \\n \\n\\x0cCombined Management Report ___ Non-Financial Statement ___ Social matters and respect for human rights \\n\\n139  \\n\\nBefore administering a new drug to humans, there must be sufficient evidence that it offers a potential \\ntherapeutic benefit, is sufficiently safe for use in humans and has a positive benefit-risk ratio. We only take the \\ncritical step of a first-in-human clinical trial after diligently conducting extensive preclinical testing. The decision \\nlies with a separate committee, the Human Exposure Group, chaired by our Global Chief Medical Officer. \\n\\nWe continuously analyze potential risks for study participants before and during our clinical studies. Our Medical \\nSafety and Ethics Board (MSEB) oversees the safety of the participants in our clinical studies and, as necessary, \\nreviews the benefit-risk profiles of investigational drugs. \\n\\nOur commitment: International guidelines and requirements \\n\\nOur Human Subjects Research and Development Policy provides the framework for conducting clinical studies \\nand helps ensure that we adhere to all applicable legal, ethical and scientific standards. In addition to the \\nrelevant national laws and regulations, these standards also include: \\n\\n•  The Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines of the International Council for Harmonisation of Technical \\n\\nRequirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) \\n\\n•  The Declaration of Helsinki, published by the World Medical Association \\n\\n•  The Belmont Report by the U.S. Office for Human Research Protections \\n\\n•  Good Pharmacovigilance/Laboratory/Manufacturing/Distribution Practices (GVP/GLP/GMP/GDP) \\n\\n•  The International Ethical Guidelines for Health-related Research Involving Humans, published by the \\n\\nCouncil for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) \\n\\n•  The Joint Position on the Disclosure of Clinical Trial Information via Clinical Trial Registries and Databases \\nand the Joint Position on the Publication of Clinical Trial Results in the Scientific Literature, published by \\nthe International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers & Associations (IFPMA), the European \\nFederation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA), the Japan Pharmaceutical Manufacturers \\nAssociation (JPMA), and the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) \\n\\n•  The Principles for Responsible Clinical Trial Data Sharing, published by EFPIA and PhRMA, and the IFPMA \\n\\nPrinciples for Responsible Clinical Trial Data Sharing \\n\\nRegular supervision of clinical studies \\n\\nOur clinical study processes and procedures are regularly inspected by relevant regulatory authorities to verify \\ntheir compliance with applicable laws and guidelines. \\n\\nThe Research & Development Quality unit applies a risk-based identification strategy to determine areas that \\nneed to be audited. Quality assurance audits are performed internally within Healthcare R&D (for example, \\nprocess audits) and externally (for example, at vendors’ sites and investigational sites). We respond \\nimmediately to observations during audits by investigating their root causes and, according to their criticality, \\ndefining and implementing corrective and preventive actions to improve processes, prevent reoccurrence of \\nirregularities and ensure compliance. \\n\\nA hybrid auditing approach combining remote and on-site audits was successfully implemented and most of the \\naudits of the Annual Audit Plan 2022 were completed as planned. \\n\\nConducting clinical studies responsibly \\n\\nEvery clinical study follows defined procedures to ensure it is conducted to the highest quality standards in line \\nwith good working practices (GxP) for the development and manufacturing of drugs, the ethical principles of the \\nDeclaration of Helsinki and other international guidelines and regulations. In 2022, regulatory authority \\ninspections did not unveil issues which had a significant impact on patient rights, patient safety, or the data \\nintegrity of a study. \\n\\n \\n \\n\\x0cCombined Management Report ___ Non-Financial Statement ___ Social matters and respect for human rights \\n\\n140  \\n\\nDisclosure of clinical studies and publication of results \\n\\nWe are obligated to disclose findings from our clinical studies. We do this publicly in a complete, accurate, \\nbalanced, transparent, and timely manner as laid out in our Clinical Trial Disclosure Policy. We publish results \\nfrom our clinical studies in medical journals in line with applicable laws and industry codes. In this way, we \\nadhere in particular to the current version of the Good Publication Practice (GPP3) and follow the \\nrecommendations of the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE). Our Standard on Clinical \\nTrial Data Transparency underscores our strong commitment in this matter. \\n\\nEnabling early access to new medicines \\n\\nNot all patients have the opportunity to take part in a clinical study and must therefore wait for a new \\npharmaceutical product to be approved. Through our Early Access Program, we can, under specific \\ncircumstances, enable patients to gain early access to new, potentially life-saving medicines. The offer is aimed \\nat people with serious conditions who have already received all available therapies without success. It allows \\nthem to be treated with medicines that have already been clinically tested but have not yet been approved. \\nFurthermore, we offer patients who participated in one of our clinical studies post-study access to the \\ninvestigational product, provided that certain conditions are met. Here, too, we meet stringent statutory, ethical \\nand scientific standards. By performing a thorough assessment of all available data, we ensure that the \\npotential benefits outweigh the potential risks for patients. \\n\\nBioethics \\n\\nOur goal is to conduct research in an ethically responsible manner and to develop ethical frameworks that guide \\nus in making forward-looking business decisions. Patient benefit and well-being are always our top priority, \\nwhether in clinical studies, treatment with our medicines, or the distribution of our products to academic \\nresearchers and the biopharmaceutical industry. We carefully evaluate our positions when it comes to \\ncontroversial topics. \\n\\nRoles and responsibilities \\n\\nSince 2010, the Merck Ethics Advisory Panel for Science and Technology has been issuing clear \\nrecommendations on scientific and technology topics involving ethical questions as well as issues extending \\nbeyond pure bioethics, in line with our transformation into a science and technology company. Co-chaired by \\ntwo of our leading scientific experts from our senior management team, the MEAP provides recommendations \\nthat guide our actions and business activities. In addition to renowned international experts from the fields of \\nbioethics, medicine, philosophy, law, and the natural sciences, the panel also consists of technology and \\nsustainability experts. The MEAP receives its mandate from the Executive Board.  \\n\\nThe MEAP meets multiple times a year and can also be convened on an ad-hoc basis in response to emerging \\nurgent ethical issues. The meeting minutes can be accessed on our intranet, along with the recommendations \\nissued by the MEAP. Our employees can also submit topics for discussion to the panel. In addition, they may \\nreport ethical concerns through our compliance hotline or by reaching out to our Bioethics team. \\n\\nOur Stem Cell Oversight Committee (SCROC) was established on the recommendation of the MEAP back in \\n2013. This committee reviews and approves all planned in-house research activities involving the use of human \\nstem cells, ensuring compliance with legal requirements as well as our ethical guidelines. This also includes \\njoint projects with external partners. The committee consists of internal experts from our business sectors as \\nwell as external professionals from the fields of bioethics, medicine and law. \\n\\nIn 2022, we expanded the range of consulting services on ethics issues. Our goal is to also take ethics \\nperspectives into account when making forward-looking business decisions. To this end, we launched the Ethics \\nForesight project, in which external experts and selected MEAP members support our employees from the \\nbusiness units on strategically relevant ethical issues. \\n\\n \\n \\n\\x0cCombined Management Report ___ Non-Financial Statement ___ Social matters and respect for human rights \\n\\n141  \\n\\nOur commitment to policies and standards \\n\\nOur Genome Editing Principle provides a mandatory ethical and operational framework for our employees. This \\nis complemented by additional guidelines that define how we conduct research and business in an ethical \\nmanner. Our Stem Cell Principle sets the ethical boundaries for the use of human stem cells in our research. \\nOur Fertility Principle regulates our research in fertility treatment and in-vitro-fertilization. \\n\\nUse of genome-editing technologies \\n\\nCRISPR/Cas9 opens up new possibilities in genetic engineering research that could bring about major advances \\nin the treatment of serious diseases. Laws in different countries allow for a varying degree of latitude in \\napplying this technique. Bioethical positions on germline editing have been evolving for years through academic \\nand social discourse. Our position on human germline editing is as follows: \\n\\n“In accordance with the German Embryo Protection Act, we do not support the use of genome editing in human \\nembryos and clinical applications of germline interventions in humans. We recognize that there may be value in \\nresponsibly conducted related research.” \\n\\nStem cell research \\n\\nWe neither participate in clinical programs that utilize human embryonic stem cells or cloned human cells for \\nthe treatment of diseases, nor do we pursue such approaches ourselves. However, we use human embryonic \\nstem cells in our research and offer our customers several select stem cell lines. In both applications, we only \\nallow the use of human embryonic stem cells if clearly defined conditions have been met. For instance, we only \\nutilize stem cells for research purposes if our SCROC has reviewed the respective project and given approval. In \\n2022, review and approval were granted in one case. We exclusively make use of cell lines that have been \\napproved by the United States National Institutes of Health (NIH) and are allowed under the German Embryo \\nProtection Act as well as the German Stem Cell Law. \\n\\nDigital ethics \\n\\nAs it is our aim to develop and use new digital technologies responsibly, we promptly identify any ethical issues \\nthat may arise from algorithm-driven and data-based business models. Since 2021, the Merck Digital Ethics \\nAdvisory Panel (DEAP) has been focusing on complex ethical issues surrounding digital technologies and \\nsupports that our digital business model follows a holistic, ethical approach. \\n\\nRoles and responsibilities \\n\\nThe DEAP discusses ethical issues arising from our digital applications and business activities, especially in the \\nhealthcare sector. One of its main tasks is to help ensure that we develop digital innovations responsibly while \\naddressing potential digital ethics questions that could result from collecting and processing data as well as \\nfrom the use of these digital technologies.  \\n\\nThe panel, which issues recommendations on our actions as a company, consists of external international \\nscience and industry experts from the fields of digital ethics, law, Big Data technologies, digital health, \\nmedicine, and data governance. In addition, we involve bioethics experts as well as representatives from \\npatient organizations as needed. The DEAP receives its mandate from the Executive Board and our employees \\nmay submit topics for the panel to discuss. Summary minutes of DEAP meetings and the recommendations \\nmade will be available on our intranet from 2023 onwards, provided that they do not contain any confidential \\nbusiness information. The panel held four meetings in 2022, focusing on ethical challenges that could result \\nfrom our business model for bioelectronics. \\n\\n \\n \\n\\x0cCombined Management Report ___ Non-Financial Statement ___ Social matters and respect for human rights \\n\\n142  \\n\\nOur commitment: Guidelines and standards  \\n\\nAs a company, we want to position ourselves with respect to digital ethics. We are therefore developing clear \\nethical standards in this new field, primarily for critical areas, for instance handling health data, doing so in \\ncollaboration with various stakeholders and experts. \\n\\nTogether with the DEAP, we apply our Code of Digital Ethics (CoDE), in order to address issues pertaining to \\nthe ethical use of data and algorithms. The CoDE serves as a guideline for our digital business models, a tool \\nfor analyzing ethical challenges and a basis for practical DEAP recommendations. As one of our overarching \\ngovernance documents, the CoDE applies to all employees and is publicly accessible. In 2022, we developed an \\nemployee training course on the CoDE, which we plan to roll out in 2023. \\n\\nData privacy and cyber security \\n\\nThe mandate and goal of our Group Data Privacy unit is to mitigate risks and create a global framework for \\ndata privacy-compliant business operations. This unit helps to train our employees to handle data responsibly \\nand with clear accountability. It safeguards our company by providing data privacy risk assurance and ensuring \\ncompliance with relevant data privacy laws globally. Group Data Privacy also contributes to creating value for \\nthe development of digital business models. \\n\\nIt is of critical importance for our business that we protect our information systems, their contents, and our \\ncommunication channels against any criminal or unwanted activities. These include e-crime and cyberattacks, \\nsuch as unauthorized access, information leakage and misuse of data or systems. Our goal is to complete the \\nimplementation of a global and consistent data privacy management system by mid-2023. \\n\\nRoles and responsibilities \\n\\nGroup Data Privacy is an independent function, organizationally integrated into Group Compliance and Data \\nPrivacy. We have a Group Data Privacy Officer and a network of local Data Privacy Officers at various sites \\nGroup-wide. In line with external regulations, the Data Privacy Officers and their respective teams act \\nindependently and without receiving internal or external instructions. Group Data Privacy regularly \\nprepares data privacy updates and a comprehensive data privacy report. This report is submitted to the \\nExecutive Board and the Supervisory Board. \\n\\nCyber Security is part of our Group Corporate Security Office. In addition, we have a Group Chief Information \\nSecurity Officer and a network of Information Security Officers within the business sectors, each in turn \\nsupported by dedicated networks. The individual sectors hold risk ownership and act as our first line of cyber \\nsecurity defense. Our Global Cyber Security function acts as a second line of defense and has responsibilities \\nregarding cyber security risk governance and oversight. Our third line of defense comprises internal audits.  \\n\\nNew Cyber Security organization \\n\\nAt the beginning of 2022, we created a new Cyber Security organization with a mandate to improve trust and \\nstrengthen resilience against cyberattacks and data breaches. \\n\\nOur Cyber Security team defines policies and standards for cyber security (including data security) while \\nproviding oversight, tools and systems to manage and monitor our overall cyber security risk exposure. The \\nteam is also responsible for providing 24/7 cyber security monitoring and incident response capabilities across \\nthe entire company environment as well as training employees across the organization on how to protect data \\nappropriately. \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cCombined Management Report ___ Non-Financial Statement ___ Social matters and respect for human rights \\n\\n143  \\n\\nOur commitment: Guidelines and standards \\n\\nOur Data Privacy Policy and the corresponding standards and procedures define our principles for processing \\npersonal data. This approach allows us to achieve a high level of data protection for our employees, contract \\npartners, customers, and suppliers as well as patients and participants in clinical studies. Our Group-wide \\nunderstanding of data privacy is based on European legislation, in particular the European Union General Data \\nProtection Regulation (EU GDPR). We are also taking steps to meet local data privacy requirements, where \\nthese are stricter than our Group-wide standards. \\n\\nOur Group Cyber Security governance framework comprises organizational, process-related and technical \\ninformation security countermeasures based on recognized international standards. In addition, we apply \\nharmonized electronic and physical security controls (e.g. access control and security monitoring) to bolster our \\nability to handle sensitive data, such as trade secrets. \\n\\nTraining and IT tools \\n\\nIn line with the EU GDPR and our global approach to data privacy, we regularly conduct e-learning training \\ncourses in ten languages. In 2022, the completion rate for our e-learning courses was 98%. \\n\\nWe maintain a central IT tool to provide a single source for data privacy processes, such as registering data \\nprocessing activities and reporting potential data privacy incidents. In 2022, we rolled out a new data privacy \\ntool. In the reporting year, we registered no sanctioned complaints or incidents concerning breaches of \\ncustomer privacy, data leaks, theft, or loss of customer data. In three out of 57 cases, minor personal data \\nbreaches were reported to the supervisory authority. These were not sanctioned. \\n\\nData Privacy \\n\\n2019   \\n\\n2020   \\n\\n2021   \\n\\nMerck Group   \\n\\n2022 \\n\\n2022 \\nthereof: Merck KGaA \\n\\nReported violations of Data Privacy Guidelines   \\n\\n1   \\n\\n3   \\n\\n3   \\n\\nCustomer Privacy1 \\n\\nTotal number of substantiated complaints \\nreceived from outside parties \\n\\nTotal number of complaints from regulatory \\nbodies \\n\\nTotal number of identified leaks, thefts, or \\nlosses of customer data \\n\\n1 These data only reflect incidents classified as significant. \\n\\n0   \\n\\n1   \\n\\n1   \\n\\n0   \\n\\n0   \\n\\n0   \\n\\n0   \\n\\n0   \\n\\n0   \\n\\n4   \\n\\n0   \\n\\n0   \\n\\n0   \\n\\n1 \\n\\n0 \\n\\n0 \\n\\n0 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cCombined Management Report ___ Non-Financial Statement ___ Anti-corruption and anti-bribery \\n\\n144  \\n\\nAnti-corruption and anti-bribery \\n\\nCompliance management \\n\\nAs a global company, we have stringent requirements for effective compliance management. Importantly, we \\nseek to emphasize compliance by acting in line with our company values and believe that profitable business \\noperations should go hand in hand with the highest ethical standards. \\n\\nRoles and responsibilities \\n\\nOur Group Compliance function is responsible for the framework of the following core topics: the Merck Code of \\nConduct, anti-corruption and anti-bribery (including healthcare compliance, third-party due diligence, \\ntransparency reporting), anti-money laundering, antitrust, and conflicts of interest. \\n\\nTo cover these topics, we have Group-wide policies, standards and procedures in place that ensure our business \\nactivities comply with the relevant laws, regulations and international ethical standards. Other compliance-\\nrelated issues, including the respective internal regulations and guidelines, such as Pharmacovigilance, Export \\nand Import Controls, and Environment, Health, Safety, Security, Quality, are managed by the responsible \\nfunctions. \\n\\nOur Group Compliance function is responsible for our compliance portfolio, which consists of the following \\nelements: \\n\\n•  Risk Assessment: Identifying internal and external critical risks in regular business operations \\n\\n•  Policies & Procedures: Global policies, procedures and standards to mitigate identified risks  \\n\\n•  Compliance Committee/Forums: Platform for compliance-related discussion and decision-making, including \\n\\nrelevant key functions \\n\\n•  Training & Awareness: Appropriate training and additional measures to educate and keep awareness high \\n\\n•  Programs & Tools: Comprehensive compliance programs and supporting tools contributing to internal \\n\\ncontrols and overall governance \\n\\n•  Monitoring & Reporting: Tracking of compliance-related data; perform internal and external reporting \\n\\n•  Case Management: Timely response to reports of misconduct and implementation of corrective actions \\n\\n•  Continuous Improvement: Based on and applying to all compliance program elements \\n\\nOur Chief Compliance Officer reports on the status of our compliance activities, potential risks and serious \\ncompliance violations to the Executive Board and Supervisory Board twice a year at a minimum. As part of our \\nregular reporting processes, we compile a comprehensive compliance and data privacy report annually for the \\nExecutive Board. This includes the status of our compliance program, continuous improvement initiatives and \\nkey figures on compliance and data privacy cases. Additionally, we prepare a mid-year update to highlight \\nongoing developments and the status of relevant projects and initiatives. \\n\\nOur Chief Compliance Officer oversees all Compliance departments and the underlying Compliance Officers and \\nCompliance experts around the world. The Compliance Officers implement our compliance program within their \\nrespective areas of responsibility (adapting to local regulations) and receive guidance from our Group \\nCompliance Center of Expertise. This is a centralized body that drives the design and evolution of our \\ncompliance program across all business sectors and Group functions. \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cCombined Management Report ___ Non-Financial Statement ___ Anti-corruption and anti-bribery \\n\\n145  \\n\\nOur commitment: Guidelines and standards \\n\\nOur compliance program builds on our company values and integrates these into our compliance framework, \\nwhich consists of Group-wide policies, standards and procedures for entrepreneurial conduct. The following are \\nmandatory for all our employees: \\n\\n•  Merck Code of Conduct \\n\\n•  Human Rights Charter \\n\\n•  Anti-Corruption Standard  \\n\\n•  Anti-Money Laundering Group Standard  \\n\\n•  Conflict of Interest Policy \\n\\n•  Antitrust and Competition Law Policy \\n\\n•  Compliance Reporting and Investigation Policy \\n\\n•  Dawn Raid Policy \\n\\n•  Standard on Local Compliance Standards \\n\\n•  Supplier Code of Conduct (formerly Responsible Sourcing Principles) \\n\\nRisk assessment \\n\\nProper compliance risk management is crucial to identify undetected risks and ensure our company remains \\nprotected. For this purpose, we are implementing a compliance risk identification process. We started this \\ninitiative by launching a global compliance risk process for all our business sectors to improve objectivity and \\nenable a more data-driven risk approach. In addition, we established a comprehensive risk matrix that focuses \\non bribery and corruption risks, illustrated through in-depth risk categorization and risk scenarios. As a next \\nstep, in 2022, we started conducting country-based risk assessments. This approach considers gross and net \\nrisks while looking at tangible risk scenarios for the respective business. During this process, Group Compliance \\nworks closely with the businesses to enhance their risk awareness and create a better understanding of \\ncompliance risks. The first round of this process includes high-risk countries. By 2022, we rolled out a risk \\nidentification process to get a better risk overview on bribery and corruption related risks. \\n\\nConflicts of interest \\n\\nWe take all potential conflicts of interest seriously. Employees must avoid situations where their professional \\njudgment may come into conflict with their personal interests. They must also disclose every potential conflict \\nof interest to their supervisor and document the disclosure. Such issues are typically resolved directly between \\nthe employee and the supervisor but can also be routed to Human Resources, Legal, Compliance, or other \\nrelevant functions. \\n\\nManagement and requirements of third parties \\n\\nFor compliance management to be effective, it must not be restricted to the boundaries of our own company. \\nWhile our supplier management processes focus on vendor compliance with our standards, our global Third \\nParty Risk Management process governs interactions with sales parties, such as commercial agents, distributors \\nand dealers. We expect our third parties worldwide to adhere to our compliance principles. We collaborate only \\nwith parties who pledge to comply with relevant laws, reject all forms of bribery, and adhere to environmental, \\nhealth and safety guidelines. \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cCombined Management Report ___ Non-Financial Statement ___ Anti-corruption and anti-bribery \\n\\n146  \\n\\nWe apply a risk-based approach to select the third parties with whom we do business. The greater the \\nestimated risk regarding a particular country, region, or type of service, the more in-depth we examine the \\nthird party before entering into a business relationship. We also explore background information from various \\ndatabases and information reported by third parties. \\n\\nIf we encounter compliance concerns, we further analyze and verify the relevant information. Based on the \\noutcome, we decide whether to reject the potential third party, impose conditions to mitigate identified risks or \\nterminate the existing relationship. By end of 2023, we plan that all subsidiaries of our company will have a \\nnew Third Party Risk Management process and tool, for due diligence of all high risk third parties – to conduct \\nbusiness only with those that are legally compliant.  \\n\\nCompliance training \\n\\nWe provide regular compliance classroom and online training courses on our Code of Conduct, anti-corruption, \\nantitrust, data privacy, anti-money laundering, and healthcare compliance standards. We require employees to \\ntake these courses based on their exposure to risk. Some courses also apply to independent contractors and \\nsupervised workers, such as temporary employees.  \\n\\nWe introduced a new Conflicts of Interest e-learning module that explains what conflicts of interests are and \\nhow these should be managed within our company. The course is available in nine languages. Furthermore, we \\nlaunched a new e-learning course to provide an overview of our Third-Party Risk Management and to \\nemphasize the importance of Third-Party Risk Assessments. \\n\\nAnti-money laundering \\n\\nWe have implemented a global anti-money laundering (AML) program consisting of a global Anti-Money \\nLaundering Group Standard, training and a dedicated process to report and investigate red flags as well as any \\nhigh-risk transactions. Suspicious transactions are reported to the German Financial Intelligence Unit or other \\nauthorities as required. \\n\\nWe aim to continuously improve our AML program. Following a worldwide risk assessment in 2021 to identify \\njurisdictions imposing the strictest legal and regulatory frameworks applicable to our businesses, we initiated \\nin-depth AML risk assessments for higher-risk jurisdictions. Based on these assessments and constant review of \\nchanges in the legal environment, we are implementing stricter local AML programs where required.  \\n\\nReporting potential compliance violations \\n\\nWe encourage all employees worldwide to report potential compliance violations to their supervisors, Legal, HR \\nor other relevant departments. Globally, they can also use our central whistleblowing compliance hotline free of \\ncharge and anonymously to report violations in their local language by telephone or via a web-based \\napplication. Reports of potential compliance violations that we receive via our compliance hotline are reviewed \\nby the Compliance Investigations and Case Management team.  \\n\\nCases with a certain risk profile are presented to the Compliance Case Committee, which comprises senior \\nrepresentatives from our Compliance, Corporate Security, Data Privacy, Human Resources, Internal Auditing, \\nand Legal departments. The Committee’s duties include assessing and classifying certain compliance issues, \\ninvestigating their background, and addressing these issues using appropriate measures. \\n\\nBased on the investigation outcome and recommendations from the compliance investigation team or the \\nCompliance Case Committee, appropriate disciplinary action may be taken against employees who have \\ncommitted a compliance violation. If, during the investigation, a root cause is identified that could lead to the \\nrisk of further compliance violations, we take preventive and corrective actions. \\n\\nThe compliance hotline is also available to external stakeholders. The relevant information can be found in the \\nCompliance and Ethics section of our website. \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cCombined Management Report ___ Non-Financial Statement ___ Anti-corruption and anti-bribery \\n\\n147  \\n\\nThe number of suspected compliance violations reported remained stable compared with the previous year, \\nwhile the number of confirmed compliance violations decreased.

As part of the audits, Group Internal Auditing regularly reviews functions, processes and legal entities \\nworldwide. These reviews include an assessment of the effectiveness of the respective compliance guidelines, \\nprocesses and structures in place. The units also check for violations of our Code of Conduct and our Anti-\\nCorruption Standard.  \\n\\nOur audit planning aims to provide comprehensive risk assurance through the best possible audit coverage of \\nour processes. We take a risk-based approach to our annual audit planning process, considering factors such as \\nsales, employee headcount, systematic stakeholder feedback and the Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) \\npublished by the non-governmental organization Transparency International. If an internal audit gives rise to \\nrecommendations, Group Internal Auditing performs a systematic follow-up and monitors the implementation of \\nthe recommended corrective actions. In 2022, Group Internal Auditing conducted 79 internal audits involving \\nbribery and corruption-related risks, including 52 operational and 24 IT audits and 3 special audits which may, \\nfor example, be initiated as part of incident-specific internal investigations. \\n\\nInteractions with health systems \\n\\nWe support health systems by providing information to our healthcare stakeholders, such as professional \\nmedical associations, patient advocacy groups, university clinics and other institutions that provide healthcare. \\nWe follow clearly defined internal approval requirements and procedures for each type of interaction, in line \\nwith applicable laws and codes. In countries with statutory or industry obligations on the disclosure of transfers \\nof value to healthcare stakeholders, we aim to comply with these obligations. \\n\\nDirect-to-consumer advertising only in certain countries \\n\\nDirect-to-consumer (DTC) advertising for prescription medicines is permitted in some countries, such as the \\nUnited States. In line with applicable local laws, we use DTC advertising in these countries to help increase \\npeople’s awareness of certain diseases and the available therapies.  \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cCombined Management Report ___ Non-Financial Statement ___ Anti-corruption and anti-bribery \\n\\n148  \\n\\nRoles and responsibilities \\n\\nFor all interactions with healthcare stakeholders, we have established internal policies and review processes and \\ntools, such as record-keeping systems, to ensure adherence to statutory requirements and transparency \\nobligations.  \\n\\nOur Global Regulatory Affairs unit has established a dedicated standard and corresponding process document \\non the review and approval of our promotional materials for our Healthcare business sector. At the operational \\nlevel, the relevant business and all employees involved in our sales and marketing activities must adhere to our \\ninternal policies, standards and procedures. \\n\\nTo ensure that all promotional materials meet our standards as well as local regulations end-to-end, we apply a \\nharmonized Group-wide review and approval system. \\n\\nOur commitment: Group-wide guidelines and industry standards \\n\\nIn addition to applicable laws and our own internal standards, we comply with the codes of conduct of various \\ninternational and local industry organizations, such as the Code of Practice published by the International \\nFederation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers & Associations (IFPMA) and the Code of Practice of the European \\nFederation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA) or the regulations of the U.S. Pharmaceutical \\nResearch and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA). \\n\\nMoreover, we apply various specific internal rules and regulations: \\n\\n•  Pharma Code for Conducting Pharmaceutical Business and Pharmaceutical Operations (Pharma Code) \\n\\n•  Healthcare Ethical Guiding Principles \\n\\n•  Standard on Medical Activities  \\n\\n•  Policy on Interactions with Patients, Patient Opinion Leaders, and Patient Organizations  \\n\\n•  Guideline Good Practice and Process Guidance: Engagement with Patients, Patient Opinion Leaders, and \\n\\nPatient Organizations. \\n\\nTransparent reporting \\n\\nWe publish the financial and non-financial contributions we make to healthcare stakeholders in the healthcare \\nindustry, such as healthcare professionals and healthcare organizations, as appropriate and in accordance with \\nlocal laws and codes. The published information includes the names of individual recipients, their addresses, the \\npurpose, and the contributed amount or value as required by the applicable laws and codes. In addition, before \\npublishing, we secure all necessary informed consent forms, as required by the applicable data privacy \\nregulations. \\n\\nRegular employee training \\n\\nWe are continuing our Code of Conduct training curriculum on managing dilemmas in sector-specific situations. \\nEmployees who are responsible for the promotion of our pharmaceutical products receive regular training on \\ncurrent guidelines. Depending on their roles and responsibilities, new employees, participate in onboarding \\ntraining dealing with the review and approval of promotional materials. Based on their roles and responsibilities \\nand to remain up-to-date, employees participate in mandatory e-learning courses and classroom training on our \\npolicies and guidelines, as well as important changes to the reporting requirements for transfers of value.\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cCombined Management Report ___ Non-Financial Statement ___ Other topics \\n\\n149  \\n\\nOther topics \\n\\nSustainable innovation and technology \\n\\nThe sustainable innovation that we envision or drive forward must align with and support the three goals of our \\nsustainability strategy. We define sustainable innovation as new or improved products, services, technologies, \\nor processes that generate economic benefits and have positive environmental and social impacts. Therefore, \\nwe develop long-term solutions for our innovation and research activities that consider the entire value chain \\nand evaluate each product’s impact over its lifecycle.  \\n\\nToday, our products already have a positive impact on human progress and global health, namely our \\nmedicines and our biological and chemical innovations that utilize the latest technologies. We want to \\ncontinuously improve the way we measure our progress by adapting and integrating sustainability criteria into \\nour product development processes across the business sectors. \\n\\nIn 2022, we continued our partnership with the well-established patent information platform LexisNexis® \\nPatentSight®. In this context, we created a framework to evaluate the sustainability impact of our intellectual \\nproperty. For 2022, we evaluated the baseline for the first time and identified that 27% of our patent families \\npublished that year have a positive sustainability impact based on LexisNexis® PatentSight®. \\n\\nRoles and responsibilities \\n\\nThe organizational set-up of our R&D activities reflects the overall structure of our company. All three of our \\nbusiness sectors operate independent R&D units that pursue their own innovation strategies. Group Corporate \\nSustainability supports our business sectors and Group functions to advance and integrate sustainability within \\nthe R&D and innovation processes in line with our shared goals. We developed a methodology for creating a \\nGroup-wide overview of the potential contribution of our R&D portfolio towards sustainable solutions that went \\nlive in December 2022. \\n\\nOur Group Science & Technology Office leads the implementation of our combined strategy for innovation, data \\nand digital, enabling innovation across our business sectors while harnessing the power of advanced data and \\ndigital capacities. It aims to identify and integrate transformative, strategically relevant technology trends into \\nour business sectors while maintaining a Group-wide view of our tech roadmap and innovation portfolio. \\nFostering data and digital capacities is key to accelerating sustainable innovation and enabling rapid action and \\npersonalized offerings. Innovation projects are incubated either through our corporate innovation teams or in \\nthe business sectors. \\n\\nOur venture capital fund, M Ventures, prioritizes sustainable innovations through equity investments. The \\nfund’s mandate is to invest in innovative technologies and products that have the potential to significantly \\nimpact our core business areas. In addition, the fund focuses on investments in two areas of high strategic \\nrelevance to our company: digital technology and sustainability. \\n\\nM Ventures’ sustainability investment strategy follows two fundamental approaches. First, it invests in \\nsustainable solutions relevant to our three business sectors, such as novel solutions for reducing emissions and \\nwaste, green life science technologies and green electronics technologies. These solutions may be more energy- \\nor resource-efficient or may create products designed for circularity or with a lower carbon footprint. The \\nsecond approach involves making investments that leverage our core competencies to drive sustainability in \\nother markets. These may include start-ups addressing sustainable foods, bio-manufacturing, or carbon capture \\nand utilization. \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cCombined Management Report ___ Non-Financial Statement ___ Other topics \\n\\n150  \\n\\nOur commitment: Aiming for circularity \\n\\nWithin our R&D processes, we are committed to continuously improving and integrating sustainability and \\ncircular economy criteria to assess the sustainability performance of our products and portfolio. For example, \\nour Life Science business sector developed Design for Sustainability (DfS) and the DOZN™ tool to create more \\nsustainable products for our customers. In 2022, we tailored and rolled out the DfS concept to our two other \\nbusiness sectors and integrated an overarching company dashboard. In 2023, we aim to generate an \\nunderstanding of our R&D portfolio and use the insights to steer future R&D activities. Therefore, we have \\ndeveloped an indicator to track our progress. In addition, we have dedicated corporate resources for our \\ncircular economy strategy and we are driving several circular economy pilots and initiatives throughout the \\norganization. \\n\\nReporting in accordance with the EU Taxonomy Regulation \\n\\nFundamentals \\n\\nThe EU taxonomy for sustainable activities (hereinafter “EU Taxonomy”) is a classification system that \\ntranslates the climate and environmental objectives of the European Union (EU) into criteria for sustainable \\neconomic activities. For this purpose, the EU Taxonomy defines various key performance indicators and \\nqualitative information that Merck must disclose. The disclosure obligation under Article 8 of Regulation (EU) \\n2020/852 of the European Parliament and of the European Council dated June 18, 2020 on establishing a \\nframework to facilitate sustainable investment and amending Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 (hereinafter “EU \\nTaxonomy Regulation”) and the Delegated Acts adopted in this regard is being carried out in multiple phases: \\n\\n•  For the 2021 reporting period, key performance indicators were stated only for so-called taxonomy-eligible \\n\\neconomic activities and were limited to those that make a substantial contribution to climate change \\nmitigation or climate change adaptation as defined by the EU Taxonomy Regulation. An economic activity \\nqualifies as taxonomy-eligible if it is within the scope of the EU Taxonomy.  \\n\\n•  For the 2022 reporting period, apart from the degree of taxonomy-eligible economic activities making a \\n\\nsubstantial contribution to climate change mitigation or climate change adaptation within the meaning of the \\nEU Taxonomy Regulation, it is also necessary to report the taxonomy-aligned share of the identified \\neconomic activities. According to the EU Taxonomy, an economic activity qualifies as taxonomy-aligned if it \\nis taxonomy-eligible and makes a substantial contribution to one or more of the environmental objectives \\nwithout doing significant harm to the other objectives or failing to fulfill minimum social standards. \\n\\n•  As of the 2023 reporting period, four further environmental objectives of the EU are likely to be included in \\n\\nthe disclosure obligation: 1) sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources, 2) transition to a \\ncircular economy, 3) pollution prevention and control, and 4) protection and restoration of biodiversity and \\necosystems.  \\n\\nApproach \\n\\nTo ensure the legally compliant fulfillment of its disclosure obligations, in 2020 Merck established an \\ninterdisciplinary project team that is continuously analyzing the existence of taxonomy-eligible and taxonomy-\\naligned activities in close coordination with the representatives of the business sectors and various Group \\nfunctions.  \\n\\nThe identification of the taxonomy-eligible economic activities for the environmental objectives “climate change \\nmitigation” and “climate change adaptation” proceeded in line with a top-down approach using structured \\ninquiries submitted to the relevant specialist departments. The results of this analysis were confirmed by \\nsupplementary big data-supported analyses as part of a bottom-up approach. Among other things, information \\nwas used that can also be found in connection with the requirements of the REACH regulation as well as in the \\ncontext of customs declarations. \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cCombined Management Report ___ Non-Financial Statement ___ Other topics \\n\\n151  \\n\\nThe three key performance indicators (KPIs), namely net sales, capital expenditure and operating expenditure, \\nwere mainly derived from existing financial reporting systems; for capital expenditure inquiries were made to \\nthe Investment Controlling unit in some instances.  \\n\\nMethodology for determining the taxonomy KPIs requiring publication \\n\\nThe EU Taxonomy Regulation and the corresponding Delegated Acts contain wording and requirements which, \\neven taking into account the supplementary publications of the EU Commission and the “EU Platform on \\nSustainable Finance”, are subject to interpretation and for which clarifications have not yet been published in \\nevery case. The most significant interpretive issues arising in this context are presented below.  \\n\\nTaxonomy-eligible economic activities of Merck  \\n\\nTo check the taxonomy eligibility of an economic activity, Merck applies an end-product oriented approach for \\nmanufacturing-related activities. This means that the end product must result from one of the economic \\nactivities specified in the Delegated Act in order to qualify as being taxonomy-eligible. In the case of organic \\nbasic chemicals, the corresponding economic activities only qualify as taxonomy-eligible in the interpretation of \\nMerck if the manufacturing activities of the named chemical products involve a significant transformation \\nprocess. In our interpretation, products that are merely passed on for sale, repackaged or mixed do not qualify \\nas taxonomy-eligible within the meaning of the EU Taxonomy Regulation.  \\n\\nIn the course of implementing the EU Taxonomy requirements, the business model of Merck underwent a \\ncomprehensive analysis. The core business activities of Merck are not mentioned in the economic activities set \\nforth by the Delegated Act. Consequently, taxonomy-eligible activities were only identified to a very small \\nextent in conjunction with the production of energy-efficient building equipment in the Electronics business \\nsector. By contrast, neither the manufacture nor the distribution of pharmaceutical products or the distribution \\nof specialty chemicals, which form the core of the business activities of the Life Science and Electronics \\nbusiness sectors, qualify as application areas of the EU Taxonomy Regulation for the first two environmental \\nobjectives. Furthermore, ancillary activities that are operationally necessary for our core business also do not \\nqualify as independent taxonomy-eligible economic activities. This applies, for example, to the acquisition or \\nconstruction of production buildings, the transport of our products to our customers as well as to research and \\ndevelopment activities that cannot be allocated to a taxonomy-eligible economic activity for the first two \\nenvironmental objectives “climate change mitigation” and “climate change adaptation”. \\n\\nWith respect to capital expenditure, the EU Taxonomy Regulation differentiates between three categories of \\ncapital expenditure: \\n\\n•  Capital expenditure that relates to assets or processes associated with taxonomy-aligned economic activities \\n\\n(Category A), \\n\\n•  Capital expenditure that is part of a plan to expand taxonomy-aligned economic activities or to transform \\n\\ntaxonomy-eligible economic activities into taxonomy-aligned economic activities (Category B), and \\n\\n•  Capital expenditure related to the acquisition of products from taxonomy-eligible economic activities and \\nindividual measures that carry out the target activities in a low-carbon manner or reduce greenhouse gas \\nemissions (Category C). \\n\\nBecause Merck only engages in taxonomy-eligible economic activities in the area of manufacturing energy-\\nefficient building equipment to a very small extent owing to its business model, it has no significant capital \\nexpenditure in category A. Furthermore, Merck has no capital expenditure in category B since it does not \\nprepare any capital spending plans to transform the taxonomy-eligible economic activities for the first two \\nenvironmental objectives “climate change mitigation” and “climate change adaptation” into taxonomy-aligned \\neconomic activities. This is attributable to the fact that there are hardly any taxonomy-eligible activities due to \\nthe business model of the Group. \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cCombined Management Report ___ Non-Financial Statement ___ Other topics \\n\\n152  \\n\\nConsequently, Merck only has capital expenditure for the first two environmental objectives resulting from the \\nacquisition of products classified as taxonomy-eligible economic activities or are attributable to qualifying \\nindividual measures (Category C). In order to be taxonomy-eligible, this capital expenditure must correspond to \\none of the economic activities named in the Delegated Acts and be implemented and operational within 18 \\nmonths. At Merck, such capital expenditure exists especially in connection with   \\n\\n• \\n\\ntransport by motorbikes, passenger cars and light commercial vehicles (activity 6.5) \\n\\n•  construction and real estate (activities 7.2 to 7.7). \\n\\nIn order to exclude double counting, capital spending on products from taxonomy-aligned economic activities \\nand individual measures that have already been checked under category A are only included under category A. \\nAgainst this background, capital expenditure for production buildings, for example, is only subject to a \\ntaxonomy-eligibility check under category A, while capital expenditure for administrative buildings is included \\nunder category C. \\n\\nTaxonomy alignment of the economic activities of Merck \\n\\nIn order to check the taxonomy alignment of the taxonomy-eligible economic activities, the relevant regulations \\nfor the technical screening criteria under which certain economic activities qualify as contributing substantially \\nto the environmental objective as well as for determining whether the activity causes no significant harm to any \\nof the other environmental objectives were systematically analyzed. The basis for this was the Delegated Acts \\non the EU Taxonomy, which were used for the identification of taxonomy-eligible economic activities. In these, \\ncorresponding requirements are defined for the respective economic activities, which must be fulfilled for a \\nclassification as taxonomy-aligned. For this purpose, interviews were conducted with business and project \\nmanagers and physical climate risk analyses were carried out at the sites. Furthermore, operating permits, \\nproduct data sheets, environmental product declarations, energy performance certificates and internal training \\ndocuments were inspected, among other things. \\n\\nMinimum safeguards \\n\\nThe minimum protection frameworks include the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, the United \\nNations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, the fundamental conventions of the International \\nLabour Organization, and the International Bill of Human Rights. The requirements profile of the frameworks \\nwas systematized and compared with internal documents. This included an analysis of the Code of Conduct, \\nwork instructions, guidelines and training documents. Compliance with the due diligence process required by \\nthe framework in the area of human rights is ensured with respect to the individual business activities. Risk \\nanalyses are carried out with regard to the minimum protection requirements and appropriate measures are \\nderived from these. \\n\\nTaxonomy KPIs \\n\\nNet sales \\n\\nThe KPI net sales represents the ratio of net sales from taxonomy-eligible or taxonomy-aligned economic \\nactivities in a fiscal year to the total net sales of the same fiscal year. The definition of relevant net sales for the \\npurposes of the EU Taxonomy Regulation corresponds to the definition of net sales in the consolidated financial \\nstatements (see Note (9) “Net sales\" in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements).  \\n\\nCapital expenditure \\n\\nThe share of capital expenditure on assets or processes associated with economic activities classified as \\ntaxonomy-eligible or taxonomy-aligned is determined as follows: Share of total capital expenditure that is \\ntaxonomy-eligible or taxonomy-aligned divided by total capital expenditure according to the EU Taxonomy \\nRegulation. At Merck and within the meaning of the EU Taxonomy Regulation, capital expenditure in the \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cCombined Management Report ___ Non-Financial Statement ___ Other topics \\n\\n153  \\n\\nreporting period comprises additions to property, plant and equipment (IAS 16), rights of use from leases \\n(IFRS 16), and intangible assets (IAS 38) with the exception of goodwill. Apart from the additions, advance \\npayments for the named assets are also included. The denominator also includes additions to property, plant \\nand equipment and intangible assets resulting from business combinations. The additions can be seen in the \\nchanges in property, plant and equipment and intangible assets disclosed in the consolidated financial \\nstatements (see Note (20) “Property, Plant and Equipment” and Note (19) “Other Intangible Assets” in the \\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements) \\n\\nOperating expenditure  \\n\\nThe share of operating expenditure for assets or processes associated with economic activities classified as \\ntaxonomy-eligible or taxonomy-aligned is determined as follows: Share of total operating expenditure that is \\ntaxonomy-eligible or taxonomy-aligned divided by total operating expenditure according to the EU Taxonomy \\nRegulation. Operating expenditure relevant within the scope of reporting under the EU Taxonomy Regulation \\nincludes direct, non-capitalized research and development costs, low-value leases, building renovations, \\nmaintenance and repair, and all other direct internal and external expenses related to the day-to-day \\nmaintenance of property, plant and equipment that are necessary to ensure the continuous and effective \\nfunctioning of these assets. \\n\\nFossil gas-related activities \\n\\nMerck operates a gas turbine and a co-generation unit to generate electricity and heat from fossil gaseous \\nfuels. The unit serves to generate our own power and heat. The activities in the area of electricity generation \\nfrom fossil gaseous fuels as well as the operation of co-generation units with fossil gaseous fuels are not \\nsignificant at Merck. Additional activities in the field of nuclear energy and fossil gas are not performed. \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cCombined Management Report ___ Non-Financial Statement ___ Other topics

\\n\\nThe low share of taxonomy-eligible net sales, capital expenditure and operating expenditure in connection with \\nthe environmental objective “climate change mitigation” is mainly due to the very limited conformity of the \\nbusiness activities of Merck with the economic activities set forth in the EU Taxonomy Regulation.  \\n\\nResearch and development expenses accounted for € 2,521 million (2021: 2,426 million) of the reported \\noperating expenditure, with € 1,694 million (2021: € 1,712 million) of this being attributable to the Healthcare \\nbusiness sector.  \\n\\nNo additional taxonomy-eligible and taxonomy-aligned net sales, capital expenditure or operating expenditure \\nwere identified for the environmental objective “climate change adaptation”. \\n\\nOutlook \\n\\nFor the environmental objective “pollution prevention and control,” which is likely to be disclosed for the first \\ntime for the 2023 reporting period, Merck expects a higher share of taxonomy-eligible economic activities than \\nfor the objectives “climate change mitigation” and “climate change adaptation”, which are already subject to \\nthe reporting requirement. This assessment is based on proposals for technical screening criteria by the \\n“Technical Working Group of the EU Platform on Sustainable Finance”, which, with respect to the environmental \\nobjective “pollution prevention and control”, list to a vast extent the production of chemicals, pharmaceutical \\nand chemical products, and pharmaceutical products as taxonomy-eligible economic activities. These proposals \\nwill flow into the development of the Delegated Act through which the European Commission will define the \\ntechnical screening criteria. As regards the degree of taxonomy alignment of the relevant economic activities \\nfor the environmental objective “pollution prevention and control”, a reliable estimate is not possible at the \\npresent time due to the uncertain legal situation.\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cCombined Management Report ___ Compensation Report \\n\\n158  \\n\\nCompensation Report \\n\\nThis compensation report describes the structure and application of the compensation system for the Executive \\nBoard of Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, in the fiscal year 2022. It provides a transparent overview of the \\nrelationship between compensation and performance, and presents the compensation awarded or due to the \\nmembers of the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board in the 2022 fiscal year. The compensation report \\nhas been jointly prepared by the Supervisory Board and the Executive Board in accordance with the provisions \\nof Section 162 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) and the recommendations of the German Corporate \\nGovernance Code in the version dated April 28, 2022. It has formally and materially been audited by KPMG AG \\nWirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft in line with the requirements of Section 162 (3) AktG as part of the combined \\nmanagement report. The compensation report and the corresponding audit opinion as part of the audit opinion \\non the annual financial statements of Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, can be found on our website.  \\n\\nThe legislation and regulations relating to the compensation report are geared toward the situation at a German \\nstock corporation (“Aktiengesellschaft” or “AG”) and do not take into consideration the special characteristics of \\na corporation with general partners (“Kommanditgesellschaft auf Aktien” or “KGaA”), such as our company. \\nMajor differences between the two legal forms exist in terms of liability and management. In the case of an AG, \\nonly the AG is liable as a legal entity, whereas the general partners of a KGaA also have unlimited personal \\nliability for the company’s obligations (Section 278 (1) AktG). Unlike the management board members of an \\nAG, the members of the Executive Board of our company are personally liable partners of both Merck KGaA, \\nDarmstadt, Germany, and the general partner E. Merck KG, Darmstadt, Germany, and not merely employed \\nmembers of a corporate board. Given the structural differences between an AG and a KGaA, several \\nrecommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code apply to a KGaA only in a modified form. \\n\\nReview of the 2022 fiscal year \\n\\nThe fiscal year 2022 was a year of continued growth, both financially and in terms of value creation for \\npatients, customers, and investors. At the same time, the market environment was characterized by tensions \\ndue to the war in Ukraine, Covid-19, the progressive effects of climate change and geopolitical tensions. This \\nwas also reflected on the stock markets. The Merck share price has been influenced by major fluctuations over \\nthe fiscal year 2022.  \\n\\nAll three business sectors, Life Science, Healthcare and Electronics, contributed significantly to Merck’s success \\nin the fiscal year 2022. Our “Big 3”, Process Solutions and Life Science Services, new Healthcare products, and \\nSemiconductor Solutions, were key to growth, combined with the strong performance of established portfolio \\nproducts. Thanks to the strong growth, we now have excellent financial flexibility, enabling the implementation \\nof our very ambitious investment and growth plans.  \\n\\nIn addition to commercial success, we strongly focused on sustainability as integrated component of our \\nstrategy in 2022. We set clear sustainability goals, which were linked to the LTIP 2022 by the sustainability \\nfactor. In 2022, the independent Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) confirmed that our 2030 emissions \\ntargets are in line with the current state of climate science. Merck is thus contributing to limiting global \\nwarming to 1.5 °C and thus fulfilling the requirements of the Paris Climate Agreement.  \\n\\nIn the fiscal year 2022, severe inflation, the energy crisis and ongoing disruptions to global supply chains were \\na major challenge for us. Rising costs impacted our business, our customers, and our employees. Regarding \\nemployee compensation, we continuously monitor the markets and take appropriate targeted action as needed \\nto ensure that our compensation remains competitive. We are aware of the pressures and significant social \\nimpacts on our employees –particularly those with lower incomes. We closely monitored inflation and wage \\ntrends and took proactive measures in selected markets by adjusting salaries during the year. We also \\nintroduced other supportive benefits for our employees. This is an ongoing process, and we will continue to \\nensure that we provide appropriate salary adjustments to all employees. We will look for ways to protect our \\nlower-income employees who are most affected by the rising cost of living.  \\n\\n \\n\\x0cCombined Management Report ___ Compensation Report \\n\\n159  \\n\\nIn the fiscal year 2022 there was no increase of the contractually agreed compensation of the Executive Board. \\nWe have met the challenges with strong economic performance which is reflected in the payouts of the variable \\ncompensation components. This follows the “pay for performance” principle of the compensation system, which \\nmeans that excellent performance is rewarded while missed targets are taken into account accordingly. Further \\ndetails can be found in the Compensation System approved by the Annual General Meeting 2021 and published \\non our website.  \\n\\nFurthermore, during the fiscal year 2022 the composition of the Executive Board remained unchanged and \\nstable. There were no personnel changes. In the Supervisory Board there was one change of mandate. Effective \\nMay 15, 2022, Edeltraud Glänzer left the Supervisory Board and as of July 14, 2022 Birgit Biermann took over.  \\n\\nApproval of the Compensation Report 2021 \\n\\nAt the Annual General Meeting 2022, the Compensation Report 2021 was approved with a voting result of \\n84.73%. Only shares traded in the free float are entitled to vote at the Annual General Meeting. \\n\\nIn relation to the Annual General Meeting 2022 and in ten investor meetings after the Annual General Meeting, \\nMerck obtained feedback from investors and all relevant shareholder associations and proxy advisors regarding \\nthe compensation of the Executive Board and its presentation in the Compensation Report 2021. Similar to the \\nvoting results, we received mostly positive feedback to last year’s revision of the Compensation Report. In \\nparticular, the increasingly transparent presentation was positively highlighted.  \\n\\nWe have implemented the suggestion to present the individual maximum amount of the profit sharing and to \\nexplain the adjustment factor for increasing or reducing the profit sharing in this compensation report. While \\nthe criteria of the adjustment factor are already described in the Compensation System, we are additionally \\nincluding them again in this Compensation Report to increase transparency even more. With this in mind, this \\nyear we are also publishing the target corridor of the respective indicators of the sustainability factor in the \\nLong-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) already at the beginning of the performance period for the first time. \\n\\nWe received further suggestions related to the LTIP. Regarding the performance indicator, which measures the \\nrelative performance of the share price compared to the DAX®, a more ambitious definition of the targets and, \\nin isolated cases, a longer performance period overall are desired. The current tranches show a strong share \\nperformance, which according to the system leads to a performance-related payout. Furthermore, the current \\nplan design reflects common market practice in Germany. However, we will consider such advice in the regular \\nreview of the compensation system and discuss them as part of a possible adjustment to the LTIP. \\n\\nIt was also made clear that potential adjustments of the Executive Board compensation as well as payments \\ncompensating forfeited compensation from a previous employment (sign-on payment) should be explained \\nappropriately. In this regard, we will ensure an even more transparent explanation in the future. In the fiscal \\nyear 2022 there were no compensation adjustments. \\n\\nConcerning the compensation tables, we follow the same approach as last year with the same interpretation of \\nSection 162 (1) of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG). In this context, we observe the practice of other \\ncompanies and actively follow the decisions in connection with possible model tables of the EU Commission. \\n\\nInvolving our investors is an important and ongoing process. We will continue to maintain dialogue with \\ninvestors in relation to the Annual General Meeting 2023 and beyond. Consequently, we can ensure that we \\nreceive constructive and valuable feedback which can be incorporated into both the design of the compensation \\nsystem and the decisions of the Personnel Committee. Accordingly, we will report on the feedback received in \\nthe next Compensation Report. \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cCombined Management Report ___ Compensation Report \\n\\n160  \\n\\nCompensation for fiscal year 2022 – Summary \\n\\nSummary of the compensation for the Executive Board members’ performance up to December 31, 2022 – \\nvoluntary diclosure \\n\\n1 The compensation of Kai Beckmann and Marcus Kuhnert is included in the average calculation of the further members of the Executive Board.

Merck KG, Darmstadt, Germany, that is responsible for designing and reviewing the \\ncompensation system and deciding on the amount and composition of compensation received by the Executive \\nBoard members. The Board of Partners has assigned this task to its Personnel Committee. As a result, the \\nPersonnel Committee is responsible for the development and regular review of the compensation system, i.e., \\nfor the structure and examination of the performance-independent and performance-related compensation \\nelements. The Personnel Committee also considers the compensation system for managers and employees \\nbelow Executive Board level to ensure consistency and a uniform steering effect between the compensation \\nsystems. Furthermore, the Personnel Committee is responsible for defining the annual targets and thresholds of \\nthe key performance indicators for the performance-related compensation elements.  \\n\\nIn addition to the structure of the Executive Board compensation system, the Personnel Committee is \\nresponsible for defining the specific amounts of compensation paid to the members of the Executive Board. The \\ncompensation paid to the members of the Executive Board considers the responsibilities and duties of the \\nindividual Executive Board members, and in particular their status as personally liable partners, their individual \\nperformance, and the economic situation, as well as the performance and future prospects of the company.  \\n\\nFurthermore, Executive Board compensation is oriented toward the external peer environment of our company, \\nwhich comprises the DAX® companies as well as a group of selected international competitors: \\n\\nThe international peer group was defined considering the size, business area and geographic location of the \\nheadquarters of the respective competitors. Overall, the peer group offers an appropriate ratio of companies \\nheadquartered in Europe and the United States as well as a balanced coverage of the Life Science, Healthcare \\nand Electronics business sectors. Based on the size criteria of sales, number of employees and market \\ncapitalization, Merck positions itself around the median of this international peer group. \\n\\nThe relationship between Executive Board compensation and the compensation of top management and the \\nworkforce as a whole continues to be taken into account, also in a multi-year assessment. Top management is \\ndefined as encompassing the senior levels of management below the Executive Board. The compensation of the \\nremaining workforce as a whole is based on typical employee compensation. \\n\\nThe Personnel Committee reviews the amount and structure of the Executive Board compensation by reference \\nto the peer groups described and with the assistance of an independent compensation consultant. \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cCombined Management Report ___ Compensation Report \\n\\n163  \\n\\nOverview of the structure of the compensation \\nsystem \\n\\nCompensation components  \\n\\nExecutive Board compensation fundamentally comprises three main components: base salary, profit sharing, \\nand the Long-Term Incentive Plan. This is complemented by contributions to the company pension plan as well \\nas additional benefits. There are also additional compensation arrangements for the members of the Executive \\nBoard, in particular malus and clawback provisions and a Share Ownership Guideline. \\n\\nThe performance-related compensation elements – profit sharing and the Long-Term Incentive Plan – are based \\non a multiyear performance period and are completely oriented toward the company’s long-term development. \\nIn addition, the two variable compensation components are designed to be tied to the company’s share price to \\na large extent, thereby ensuring that our shareholders’ interests are particularly considered. The key \\nperformance indicators selected for variable compensation are derived from the corporate strategy and form \\npart of our central controlling system. Like this, the variable compensation of the Executive Board members is \\nused as a strong controlling tool in order to ensure a focus on our objective of long-term profitable growth \\naccompanied by strong cost discipline. \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cCombined Management Report ___ Compensation Report \\n\\n164  \\n\\nThe following diagram shows an overview of all the elements of the compensation system for the Executive \\nBoard members: \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cCombined Management Report ___ Compensation Report \\n\\n165  \\n\\nExecutive Board compensation for 2022 \\n\\nThe performance-related and performance-independent compensation components of the compensation system \\nof the Executive Board in the fiscal year 2022 are fully consistent with the Executive Board compensation \\nsystem approved by the 2021 Annual General Meeting with a voting result of 87.08%. Compliance with the \\ncompensation system is ensured by the Personnel Committee. The compensation system for the Executive \\nBoard is published on our website. The Personnel Committee decides by resolution about the parameter of the \\ncompensation elements (e.g. setting of targets, determination of target achievement, etc.) as well as about the \\namounts to be paid out. \\n\\nThe following section reports on the compensation awarded or due in accordance with Section 162 (1) AktG. \\nAccordingly, the following sections contain all amounts received by the individual members of the Executive \\nBoard (active and former members) in the fiscal year (compensation awarded) as well as all amounts legally \\ndue but not yet received (compensation due). \\n\\nIn addition, compensation is disclosed on a voluntary basis for which the members of the Executive Board have \\nprovided the underlying service completely by December 31, 2022, but for which payment will be made in the \\nfollowing year. This relates to the profit sharing for fiscal year 2022, as well as the 2020 LTI tranche, whose \\nperformance period ended on December 31, 2022. These amounts have been provisionally determined by the \\nPersonnel Committee by way of a resolution and subsequently communicated to the members of the Executive \\nBoard. The final amount will be paid to the members of the Executive Board after the preparation of the \\nconsolidated financial statements of E. Merck KG. This enables transparent information and ensures the link \\nbetween performance and compensation in the fiscal year. \\n\\nPerformance-independent compensation \\n\\nBase salary \\n\\nAs base salary, the members of the Executive Board receive contractually fixed performance-independent \\namounts that are paid in the form of 12 equal monthly installments. \\n\\nAdditional benefits \\n\\nThe additional benefits mainly include company cars with private use, contributions to insurance policies and \\nexpenses for personal protection. \\n\\nIn addition, as compensation for the loss of entitlements to variable compensation from his previous \\nemployment, Peter Guenter received upon the initial appointment in the fiscal year 2021 a commitment to \\ncompensation totaling € 1,500,000.00 as a sign-on payment. The entitlement has been verified in the context \\nof his initial appointment on the basis of supporting documents, and the amount has been determined \\naccordingly. The compensation is to be paid in cash in four equal installments. The first installment was paid on \\nJuly 1, 2021, and the second installment on July 1, 2022. The further installments will be paid on July 1, 2023, \\nand July 1, 2024, provided the employment relationship continues.  \\n\\nPension entitlement \\n\\nThe members of the Executive Board are granted a pension obligation as a direct commitment.1 A fixed amount \\nis paid into a benefit account every year, and interest is paid at the applicable statutory maximum technical \\ninterest rate for the life insurance industry in accordance with Section 2 (1) of the Regulation on the Principles \\nUnderlying the Calculation of the Premium Reserve (DeckRV).

Merck KG, Darmstadt, \\nGermany. The fiscal year 2022 and the two preceding fiscal years are included in the calculation.  \\n\\nThe use of profit after tax as the key performance indicator, which also serves as the basis for dividend \\npayments, ensures very close alignment with shareholder interests. \\n\\nTo appropriately consider the individual performance of the Executive Board members, the Personnel Committee \\nmay modify the payment by applying a factor ranging from 0.8 to 1.2. In determining the level of this factor, the \\nPersonnel Committee applies the following criteria that also include ambitious sustainability targets.  \\n\\nBonus criteria for increasing profit sharing \\n\\n Malus criteria for decreasing profit sharing \\n\\n• Extraordinary contributions to the Sustainability goals and \\n\\n • Significantly failing to meet the Sustainability goals and \\n\\nperformance criteria “Human Progress”, “Creating sustainable \\nvalue chains ” and “Reducing our ecological footprint” (e.g. \\nCO2 reduction, employee satisfaction, customer satisfaction, \\nCorporate Social Responsibility, diversity) \\n\\nperformance criteria “Human progress”, “Creating sustainable \\nvalue chains” and “Reducing our ecological footprint” (e.g. CO 2 \\nreduction, employee satisfaction, customer satisfaction, \\nCorporate Social Responsibility, diversity) \\n\\n• Extraordinary success in connection with M&A activities of the \\n\\n • Violations of internal rules and regulations (for instance the \\n\\nMerck Group \\n\\nMerck Code of Conduct), laws or other binding external \\nrequirements in the area of responsibility \\n\\n• Extraordinary success in the sustainable strategic, technical, \\n\\nproduct-related or structural further development or \\nreorganization of the Merck Group \\n\\n • Significant breaches of duty of care within the meaning of \\nSection 93 of the German Stock Corporation Act or other \\ngrossly non-compliant or unethical behavior \\n\\n• Extraordinary performance in the execution of especially \\n\\n • Behaviors or actions that are contradictory to our company \\n\\nimportant projects or the achievement of other exceptionally \\nimportant objectives in the area of responsibility \\n\\nvalues \\n\\n• Extraordinary performance leading to a clear overachievement \\nof targets for relevant key performance indicators in the area \\nof responsibility \\n\\n • Failure to execute especially important projects or failing to \\n\\nachieve other exceptionally important objectives in the area of \\nresponsibility \\n\\n • Clear failure to achieve targets for relevant key performance \\n\\nindicators in the area of responsibility \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cCombined Management Report ___ Compensation Report \\n\\n167  \\n\\nThe performance factor makes it possible to recognize outstanding performance by a member of the Executive \\nBoard by multiplying profit sharing by a value greater than 1.0 up to 1.2. Similarly, multiplying by a value less \\nthan 1.0 down to 0.8 can reduce profit sharing if the circumstances call for it. \\n\\nThe members of the Executive Board are obligated to hold one-third of the yearly total net amount from profit \\nsharing in shares of Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, for at least four years. Further details are provided \\nunder the heading “Share Ownership Guideline”. \\n\\nThe following illustration shows the profit sharing for the 2022 fiscal year: \\n\\nAn average profit of at least € 0.75 billion must be generated for the profit-sharing payment to be made. This \\nminimum threshold reflects the “pay-for-performance” approach of the compensation system. If the profit \\nexceeds such threshold, the individual profit sharing rates are staggered. The maximum profit-sharing payment \\nis capped individually. It amounts to € 4,810 thousand for Belén Garijo, € 3,500 thousand for Kai Beckmann, \\n€ 3,900 thousand for Peter Guenter, € 3,900 thousand for Matthias Heinzel and € 3,300 thousand for Marcus \\nKuhnert. \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cCombined Management Report ___ Compensation Report \\n\\n168  \\n\\nThe three-year average that is relevant for the 2022 fiscal year was based on the profit after tax generated by \\nE.

This recognizes the performance of the members of the Executive Board which resulted in the \\nsuccessful fiscal year 2022.  \\n\\nThe Executive Board faced the many challenges resulting from the war in Ukraine, Covid-19, and geopolitical \\ntensions. The Personnel Committee recognizes that through the efforts of the Executive Board members, fiscal \\nyear 2022 was successfully concluded both in financial terms and value creation. All three business sectors, \\nLife Science, Healthcare and Electronics, contributed significantly to Merck’s success in fiscal 2022. In addition \\nto economic success, an equally strong focus was placed on sustainability. In this context, the decisions and \\nactions of the Executive Board members were positively acknowledged. \\n\\nTaking into account the relevant three-year average of the E. Merck Group’s profit after tax, the individual \\nsharing rates and the performance factor, the profit sharing for fiscal year 2022 is as follows: \\n\\nProfit sharing 2022 summary \\n\\nThree-year \\naverage profit \\nafter tax of the \\nE.

It is based on a four-year \\nfuture-oriented performance cycle that is composed of a three-year target achievement cycle and, since the \\n2021 tranche, a subsequent one-year holding period. As of fiscal year 2022, sustainability targets are taken \\ninto consideration by supplementing the LTIP by a sustainability factor in addition to three financial \\nperformance indicators. The sustainability factor has a range of 0.8 to 1.2 and can increase or reduce the target \\nachievement resulting from the financial key performance indicators by up to 20%. The following graphic \\nillustrates the calculation of the Merck Share Units (MSUs) as well as the functionality of the sustainability \\nfactor. \\n\\nCalculation of the MSUs \\n\\nThe members of the Executive Board are provisionally granted a certain number of virtual shares, so-called \\nshare units of Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany (“MSUs”). The number of MSUs is calculated as follows: An \\nindividual grant in Euros is set for each Executive Board member. Every year, this grant is divided by the \\ndefinitive reference share price at the beginning of the performance cycle, resulting in the number of MSUs that \\nthe respective member is provisionally entitled to receive.  \\n\\nIn fiscal year 2022, the allocation of the LTIP tranche 2022 was made on the basis of the following parameters: \\n\\nLTIP Tranche 2022 allocation \\n\\nBelén Garijo \\n\\nKai Beckmann \\n\\nPeter Guenter \\n\\nMatthias Heinzel \\n\\nMarcus Kuhnert \\n\\nReference Merck \\nshare price at the \\nbeginning \\n\\nGrant amount \\n(€ thousand)   \\n\\n(in €)   \\n\\n212.16 \\n\\nNumber of \\nprovisionally \\ngranted MSUs   \\n\\nMaximum payout \\n(€ thousand) \\n\\n10,841   \\n\\n8,084   \\n\\n8,956   \\n\\n8,956   \\n\\n6,599   \\n\\n5,750 \\n\\n4,288 \\n\\n4,750 \\n\\n4,750 \\n\\n3,500 \\n\\n2,300   \\n\\n1,715   \\n\\n1,900   \\n\\n1,900   \\n\\n1,400   \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cCombined Management Report ___ Compensation Report \\n\\n170  \\n\\nThe number of MSUs actually allocated to the Executive Board members after the end of the target \\nachievement cycle depends on the development of the financial performance indicators and the sustainability \\nfactor during the three-year target achievement period.  \\n\\nBased on the three financial performance indicators, the number of MSUs allocated may be between 0% and \\n150% of the provisionally granted MSUs. The resulting number of MSUs will then be multiplied by the \\nsustainability factor.  \\n\\nThe sustainability factor target achievement can range between 0.8 and 1.2 and is determined by the \\npredefined sustainability key indicators. Thus, the total number of MSUs actually allocated can amount to a \\nmaximum of 180% of the provisionally granted MSUs. \\n\\nThe target achievement period is followed by a one-year holding period. The final payout amount may be \\nbetween 0% and a maximum of 250% of the amount originally granted and depends on the number of MSUs \\nactually allocated and the reference share price at the end of the performance cycle. \\n\\nFinancial key performance indicators \\n\\nThe relevant financial key performance indicators are: \\n\\n•  The performance of the Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany share price compared with the performance of the \\n\\nDAX® with a weighting of 50%, \\n\\n•  The EBITDA pre margin as a proportion of a defined target value with a weighting of 25%, and \\n\\n•  The organic sales growth of the Merck Group as a proportion of a defined target value with a weighting of 25%. \\n\\nThe number of MSUs actually allocated after the end of the target achievement cycle is based on the following \\ntarget achievement curves. The targets and thresholds for the key performance indicators of EBITDA pre \\nmargin and organic sales growth are defined by the Personnel Committee at the start of the performance period \\nand subsequently published in the compensation report. \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cCombined Management Report ___ Compensation Report \\n\\n171  \\n\\nNon-financial key indicators of the sustainability factor \\n\\nAs a result of implementing the sustainability factor starting from fiscal year 2022, our sustainability strategy \\nwill be even more firmly incorporated into the compensation system for the members of the Executive Board. \\nOn the basis of the sustainability goals (“Human Progress” “Creating sustainable value chains” and “Reducing \\nour ecological footprint”), the Personnel Committee defines corresponding concrete and measurable \\nsustainability key indicators as well as associated target and threshold values at the beginning of each tranche \\nof the LTIP. These values are used to calculate target achievement at the end of the relevant target \\nachievement cycle. The following criteria were defined for the selection of the sustainability key indicators: \\n\\n•  Relevance and influence of the sustainability key indicators on the three overarching sustainability goals of \\n\\nthe sustainability strategy \\n\\n• \\n\\nInternal and external influence of the sustainability key indicators by management \\n\\n•  Good measurability and operationalization \\n\\n•  Sustained impact to support long-term solutions and not incentivize short-term actions  \\n\\nIn addition, the Personnel Committee determines the weighting of the individual sustainability goal for each \\ntranche of the LTIP in order to emphasize priorities. \\n\\nThe Personnel Committee has defined the following sustainability key indicators and weightings for the \\n2022 tranche of the LTIP: \\n\\nSustainability Goal \\n\\n  Weighting   \\n\\nSustainability Key Indicator \\n\\nDedicated to Human Progress \\n\\nCreating sustainable value chains \\n\\nReducing our ecological footprint \\n\\n20%   \\n\\n40%   \\n\\n40%   \\n\\nPercentage of relevant suppliers (in terms of number and supplier spend) \\nthat are covered by a valid sustainability assessment \\n\\nPeople treated with our Healthcare products \\n\\nGreenhouse gas emissions Scope 1+2 \\n\\nThe following table shows the target corridor ex ante for the respective sustainability key indicators of the three \\noverarching goals for the 2022 LTI tranche. \\n\\nSustainability Goal/Key Indicator \\n\\nHuman Progress \\n\\nNumber of people treated with Merck HC products (in million) \\n\\nNumber of people treated as part of the schistosomiasis program (in million) \\n\\nCreating sustainable value chains \\n\\nMinimum   \\n\\nTarget   \\n\\nMaximum \\n\\n165.5 \\n\\n189.0 \\n\\n200.5 \\n\\nRelevant suppliers with a valid sustainability assessment (% of all relevant \\nsuppliers) \\n\\nRelevant suppliers with a valid sustainability assessment (% of supplier spend) \\n\\n60%   \\n\\n80%   \\n\\n70%   \\n\\n90%   \\n\\n80% \\n\\n100% \\n\\nReducing our ecological footprint \\n\\nGreenhouse gas emissions in Scope 1+2 worldwide (in kt) \\n\\n1,200.0   \\n\\n1,000.0   \\n\\n800.0 \\n\\n \\n \\n   \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n    \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n   \\n \\n \\n    \\n \\n \\n\\x0cCombined Management Report ___ Compensation Report \\n\\n172  \\n\\n•  “Dedicated to Human Progress” \\n\\nWe are convinced that, with the help of science and technology, we can make a contribution to solving many \\nglobal challenges. In our Healthcare business sector, we measure the number of people worldwide who can be \\ntreated with our company’s medical products. This includes measuring the number of people who can be \\ntreated with Healthcare products in general and particularly with praziquantel against schistosomiasis as part \\nof Merck’s donation program. We plan to continuously increase this number and thus contribute to a significant \\nimprovement in medical care and the health status of as many people as possible. It is planned to also include \\na sustainability key indicator for the Life Science business sector for the LTIP 2023. This is intended to cover \\npatients treated with medical products that are enabled by key Merck Life Science technologies. \\n\\n•  “Creating sustainable value chains” \\n\\nWe measure our progress in embedding sustainability in our supply chains. We achieve this by increasing the \\ntransparency of our supply chains and subjecting more suppliers to a sustainability assessment. We are \\nfocusing particularly on suppliers where we see a sustainability risks in the supply chain and those suppliers \\nwho cover a relevant share of our supplier spend. In connection with this sustainability assessment, it is \\nimportant for us to increase the number of suppliers audited. \\n\\n•  “Reducing our ecological footprint” \\n\\nOn our path to climate neutrality, we have already joined the Science Based Targets Initiative and aim to \\nreduce both direct (Scope 1) and indirect emissions (Scope 2) by 50% by 2030 compared to 2020. This \\ntarget is to be achieved through the reduction of process-related emissions, energy efficiency measures, and \\nthe increased purchase of electricity from renewable sources. Particularly in the case of process emissions \\n(Scope 1), we aim to significantly reduce emissions through the use of new technologies. \\n\\nLTI tranches allocated prior to fiscal year 2021 \\n\\nThe tranche allocated in fiscal year 2021 is already designed with the one-year holding period but still without \\nthe sustainability factor introduced with the 2022 LTIP tranche. Accordingly, the performance period is four \\nyears and comprises the target achievement period of three years and the holding period of one year. \\nConsequently, the performance period of the LTI 2021 runs from January 1, 2021 to December 31, 2024, with \\npayment in April 2025. \\n\\nThe 2019 and 2020 tranches were structured according to the former model without a one-year holding period \\nand without a sustainability factor. Accordingly, the performance period of the 2019 and 2020 tranches is still \\nthree years without a subsequent one-year holding period. This means that the 2019 LTIP was paid out in April \\nof fiscal year 2022, with the performance period running from January 1, 2019, to December 31, 2021. The \\nperformance period of the 2020 LTIP ended in fiscal year 2022, with the performance period running from \\nJanuary 1, 2020 to December 31, 2022. It will be paid out in April 2023. \\n\\nThe targets and thresholds, the actual amounts, and the resulting target achievement for the 2019 and \\n2020 tranches can be summarized as follows: \\n\\n \\n\\x0cCombined Management Report ___ Compensation Report \\n\\n173  \\n\\nLTIP 2019 target achievement \\n\\nShare price performance relative to the DAX ® \\n(weighting: 50%) \\n\\n-20.0%   \\n\\n0.0%   \\n\\n50.0%   \\n\\n87.6%   \\n\\n150.0% \\n\\nLower target \\ncorridor limit   \\n\\nTarget   \\n\\nUpper target \\ncorridor limit   \\n\\nActual achieved \\n\\nvalue   \\n\\nTarget \\nachievement1 \\n\\nEBITDA pre margin \\n(weighting: 25%) \\n\\nOrganic sales growth \\n(weighting: 25%) \\n\\nTotal target achievement \\n\\n1 Cap of relative share price development was reached.  \\n\\nLTIP 2020 target achievement \\n\\n24.5%   \\n\\n27.5%   \\n\\n30.5%   \\n\\n29.2%   \\n\\n128.4% \\n\\n4.3%   \\n\\n7.3%   \\n\\n10.3%   \\n\\n8.0%   \\n\\n111.7% \\n\\n135.0% \\n\\nShare price performance relative to the DAX ® \\n(weighting: 50%) \\n\\n-20.0%   \\n\\n0.0%   \\n\\n50.0%   \\n\\n58.6%   \\n\\n150.0% \\n\\nLower target \\ncorridor limit   \\n\\nTarget   \\n\\nUpper target \\ncorridor limit   \\n\\nActual achieved \\n\\nvalue   \\n\\nTarget \\nachievement1 \\n\\nEBITDA pre margin \\n(weighting: 25%) \\n\\nOrganic sales growth \\n(weighting: 25%) \\n\\nTotal target achievement \\n\\n1 Cap of relative share price development was reached.  \\n\\nThe resulting payouts are as follows: \\n\\nLTIP 2019 summary \\n\\n25.6%   \\n\\n28.6%   \\n\\n31.6%   \\n\\n30.5%   \\n\\n131.7% \\n\\n5.1%   \\n\\n8.1%   \\n\\n11.1%   \\n\\n8.7%   \\n\\n110.0% \\n\\n135.4% \\n\\nReference \\nMerck share \\nprice at the \\nbeginning \\n\\n(in €)   \\n\\nNumber of \\nprovisionally \\ngranted MSUs   \\n\\nGrant amount \\n(€ thousand)   \\n\\nTotal target \\nachievement   \\n\\nFinal number of \\n\\nMSUs   \\n\\n(in €)   \\n\\nReference \\nMerck share \\nprice at the end \\n\\nStefan Oschmann \\n(until April 30, 2021) \\n\\nUdit Batra \\n(until July 13, 2020) \\n\\nKai Beckmann \\n\\nBelén Garijo \\n\\nMarcus Kuhnert \\n\\n2,255   \\n\\n1,705   \\n\\n1,530   \\n\\n1,870   \\n\\n1,320   \\n\\n93.75 \\n\\n24,054   \\n\\n18,187   \\n\\n16,320   \\n\\n19,947   \\n\\n14,080   \\n\\n135.0% \\n\\n32,479   \\n\\n24,557   \\n\\n22,036   \\n\\n26,933   \\n\\n19,012   \\n\\n212.16 \\n\\nPayout amount \\n(€ thousand)1 \\n\\n4,377 \\n\\n2,131 \\n\\n3,825 \\n\\n4,629 \\n\\n3,300 \\n\\n1 Payout capped at 250% of the grant value.

Since the \\nintroduction of the new compensation system at the beginning of fiscal 2021, the share ownership obligation \\nhas been linked to the variable compensation element of profit sharing. Under the revised SOG, members of \\nthe Executive Board are required to hold one-third of the net profit-sharing payout in shares for at least four \\nyears. The shareholding obligation thus builds up gradually over the first four fiscal years after the introduction \\nof the new compensation system. A corresponding investment was made for the first time after payment of the \\n2021 profit sharing in the fiscal year 2022 as part of an automated purchase via an external provider. \\n\\nThe following table illustrates the investment volume of the members of the Executive Board in accordance with \\nthe revised SOG. The numbers are the gross investment amounts from the corresponding profit sharing payout. \\nNo conclusions can be drawn as to the actual individual shareholdings. \\n\\nShare Ownership Guideline \\n\\nMandatory personal investment based on SOG (in € thousand)1 \\n\\nFrom profit \\nsharing 2021   \\n\\nFrom profit \\nsharing 20222   \\n\\nFrom profit \\nsharing 2023   \\n\\nFrom profit \\nsharing 2024   \\n\\nTotal   \\n\\nIn % of Base \\nSalary \\n\\nBelén Garijo (Chair since May \\n1, 2021) \\n\\nKai Beckmann \\n\\nPeter Guenter (since January \\n1, 2021) \\n\\nMatthias Heinzel (since April \\n1, 2021) \\n\\nMarcus Kuhnert \\n\\n1,224   \\n\\n951   \\n\\n1,055   \\n\\n795   \\n\\n885   \\n\\n1,463   \\n\\n1,064   \\n\\n1,184   \\n\\nInvestment is made after payout \\nof profit sharing for fiscal year \\n2023 and 2024 \\n\\n1,184   \\n\\n998   \\n\\n2,687   \\n\\n2,015   \\n\\n179% \\n\\n168% \\n\\n2,239   \\n\\n187% \\n\\n1,979   \\n\\n1,883   \\n\\n165% \\n\\n157% \\n\\n1 Gross amounts of mandatory investment from profit sharing. Investment is made on net amounts. \\n\\n2 Investment is made after payout of the profit sharing for the fiscal year 2022 in 2023.  \\n\\nThe Share Ownership Guideline promotes an even stronger alignment of the interests of the members of the \\nExecutive Board with the sustainable interests of our shareholders and additionally increases the corporate \\nresponsibility of the members of the Executive Board in addition to their status as general partners. \\n\\nMalus and clawback provisions \\n\\nThrough their status as personally liable general partners of Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, and \\nE. Merck KG, Darmstadt, Germany the Executive Board members bear a unique entrepreneurial responsibility. \\nThis is also reflected by the penalty criteria set forth in profit sharing and by the German statutory regulations \\non liability for damages stipulated in section 93 AktG. In order to take even greater account of the prominent \\nposition of entrepreneurial responsibility in compensation, a clawback provision is implemented for the LTIP. \\nCases in which the clawback provision may be applied include violations of internal rules and regulations (Code \\nof Conduct), legislation, other binding external requirements in responsibility, significant breaches of duty of \\ncare within the meaning of section 93 AktG, and other grossly non-compliant or unethical behavior or actions \\nthat are contradictory to our company values. In these cases, amounts that have already been allocated under \\nthe Long-Term Incentive Plan may be retained. The Personnel Committee is entitled to demand the repayment \\nof profit sharing and LTIP payouts from a member of the Executive Board if it subsequently transpires that the \\npayout was made wrongfully, either in full or in part. For example, this is the case when targets are not actually \\nmet or are not met to the extent assumed when the payout was calculated due to incorrect information being \\napplied. The extent of these claims for restitution is based on section 818 of the German Civil Code (BGB). The \\nPersonnel Committee may agree deadlines for the assertion of claims for restitution with the members of the \\nExecutive Board. \\n\\nNeither the malus provision nor the clawback provision were exercised in the fiscal year 2022. \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n    \\n\\x0cCombined Management Report ___ Compensation Report \\n\\n175  \\n\\nCompensation-related transactions \\n\\nContracts with the members of the Executive Board are usually concluded for a period of five years. When an \\nemployment contract begins or ends during the year, the fixed compensation, profit sharing and individual LTIP \\ntranches are paid on a pro rata basis. In fiscal year 2022 no adjustments or changes have been made to the \\ncontracts of the members of the Executive Board. \\n\\nShould members of the Executive Board be held liable for financial losses while executing their duties, this \\nliability risk is covered by a D&O insurance policy under certain circumstances. The D&O insurance policy has a \\ndeductible in accordance with the legal requirements. \\n\\nPost-contractual non-competition clause \\n\\nPost contractual non-competition clauses have been agreed with all Executive Board members except for \\nMarcus Kuhnert. With him it has been agreed to conclude an agreement about a post-contractual non-\\ncompetition clause if required. The post-contractual non-competition clause involves the payment of \\ncompensation amounting to 50% of the member’s average compensation within the last twelve months and is \\npaid for a period of two years. Other earnings, pension payments and any severance payments are offset \\nagainst this amount. \\n\\nA post-contractual non-competition clause was agreed with Stefan Oschmann. As compensation there is a \\nmonthly payment of € 343,184 in the period from May 1, 2021, to April 30, 2023. His monthly pension of \\n€ 46,667 was taken into account in determining the amount of this compensation. During the period of the non-\\ncompetition clause, further income of other work is offset against this amount. \\n\\nObligations in connection with the cessation of Executive Board membership \\n\\nThe contracts of the Executive Board members do not provide for ordinary termination. The right to \\nextraordinary termination for good cause in accordance with section 626 BGB is available to both parties \\nwithout observing a notice period. \\n\\nThe contracts of the Executive Board members may provide for the continued payment of fixed compensation \\nto surviving dependents for a limited period in the event of death. Above and beyond existing pension \\nobligations, no further obligations are provided for in the event of the termination of the contractual \\nrelationships of the Executive Board members. \\n\\nThere is a cap on the amounts payable to Executive Board members in the event of the early termination of the \\ncontract without good cause justifying such termination. Pursuant to this, payments in connection with the \\ntermination of an Executive Board member’s duties shall not exceed twice the annual total compensation or \\nconstitute compensation for more than the remaining term of the employment contract (severance cap). If an \\nExecutive Board member’s duties cease due to the termination of the employment contract either by the \\ncompany or the Executive Board member before the four-year performance cycle of an open tranche in the \\nLong-Term Incentive Plan expires, the obligations resulting from the plan continue to apply if there are specific \\ngrounds for the termination, e.g., if the employment contract is not renewed after it expires or if the Board of \\nPartners determines this to be appropriate at its own discretion; otherwise, the obligations no longer apply. \\nShould obligations resulting from the plan continue to apply any early payout is excluded. If the compensation \\nin the fiscal year in which the Executive Board member’s duties cease is expected to be significantly higher or \\nlower than in the previous fiscal year, the Board of Partners may decide to adjust the amount applied as the \\nmember’s total compensation at its own discretion. \\n\\n \\n\\x0cCombined Management Report ___ Compensation Report \\n\\n176  \\n\\nLoans, advances, payments by affiliates of Merck Group \\n\\nNone of the members of the Executive Board received any loans or advances, nor any payments by affiliates of \\nthe group in fiscal year 2022. \\n\\nPayments to former Executive Board members and their surviving dependents \\n\\nPayments to former members of the Executive Board and their surviving dependents are made as pension \\npayments, as temporary continuation of basic compensation in the event of death, as part of the profit-sharing \\nand the LTIP, and as compensation for a post-contractual non-competition clause.

Pension \\npayments are not included in the maximum compensation. \\n\\nThe maximum compensation for the fiscal year is € 11,500,000 for the Chair of the Executive Board and \\n€ 9,500,000 each for ordinary members of the Executive Board. The sum of the compensation awarded or due \\nin accordance with Section 162 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) less any pension payments and \\nplus pension expenses is below the defined maximum compensation in accordance with section 87a of the \\nGerman Stock Corporation Act (AktG) for all members of the Executive Board. \\n\\nIn addition to the maximum compensation, there is a separate payment cap for each of the performance-\\nrelated compensation elements. A maximum amount has been set for the amount of profit sharing for all \\nmembers of the Executive Board (please find more details in the paragraph “profit sharing”). The payout from \\nthe Long-Term Incentive Plan cannot exceed 2.5 times the individual award value, even in the case of \\nexceptional performance.  \\n\\nIn addition, there is a contractually agreed maximum limit on the direct compensation, i.e. the sum of base \\nsalary, profit-sharing, and LTI. In this context, it is stipulated that capping, if necessary, shall be applied first to \\nthe LTI and then to profit sharing. To ensure compliance with this cap, the 2019 LTIP payment for Belén Garijo \\nwas reduced by € 46 thousands accordingly. \\n\\nCompliance with the defined maximum compensation is ensured by the Personnel Committee setting the \\namounts of the variable compensation components by resolution. The defined maximum compensation and the \\nmaximum limit for the direct compensation of the members of the Executive Board are shown in the following \\ntable. \\n\\nOverall compensation limit \\n\\n€ thousand \\n\\nBelén Garijo \\n\\nKai Beckmann \\n\\nPeter Guenter \\n\\nMatthias Heinzel \\n\\nMarcus Kuhnert \\n\\nMaximum limit \\nfor Direct \\n\\nCompensation   \\n\\nMaximum \\ncompensation \\npursuant to \\nSection 87a \\nAktG \\n\\n9,800   \\n\\n8,000   \\n\\n8,000   \\n\\n8,000   \\n\\n8,000   \\n\\n11,500 \\n\\n9,500 \\n\\n9,500 \\n\\n9,500 \\n\\n9,500 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cCombined Management Report ___ Compensation Report \\n\\n184  \\n\\nCompensation for the Supervisory Board members in \\nfiscal year 2022 \\n\\nThe compensation of the Supervisory Board members is defined by article 20 of the Articles of Association of \\nMerck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, and corresponds to the compensation system for the Supervisory Board \\nthat was adopted by the 2022 Annual General Meeting with 99.64% of the votes cast. \\n\\nAccordingly, the members of the Supervisory Board receive fixed compensation of € 47,000 per year. The \\nChairman receives double, and the Vice Chairman receives one and a half times this amount. In addition to \\ntheir fixed compensation, Supervisory Board members who are also members of the Audit Committee, which \\nhas been established in the meeting of the Supervisory Board on February 26, 2021, receive annual \\ncompensation of € 15,000. The Chair of the Audit Committee receives an additional annual compensation of \\n€ 30,000. Moreover, the members receive an additional compensation of € 750 per meeting they attend. \\n\\nThe compensation awarded or due and the respective relative share of the total compensation for the current \\nmembers of the Supervisory Board is presented in the following table. During the fiscal year, Edeltraud Glänzer \\nresigned from the Supervisory Board effective May 15, 2022, and Birgit Biermann joined the Supervisory Board \\neffective July 14, 2022.

The Annual \\nFinancial Statements and the Combined Management Report of the Group and Merck KGaA for 2022 are filed \\nwith the electronic German company register and are available on its website. \\n\\nMerck KGaA, headquartered in Darmstadt, Germany, is the parent company of the Group. In addition to its \\nfunction as a holding company, Merck KGaA generates sales in the Life Science, Healthcare, and Electronics \\nbusiness sectors. Merck KGaA employs the majority of the 11,000-plus workforce in Darmstadt. \\n\\nThe financial statements of Merck KGaA have been prepared in accordance with the provisions of the German \\nCommercial Code (HGB), as amended by the German Accounting Directive Implementation Act (BilRUG), and \\nthe German Stock Corporation Act (AktG). The full version of the Annual Financial Statements of Merck KGaA \\ntogether with the unqualified auditor’s opinion has been submitted to the electronic company register and \\npublished there. \\n\\nStatement on Corporate Governance \\n\\nFor fiscal 2022, we exercise the option of publishing the Statement on Corporate Governance on the Group’s \\nwebsite in accordance with section 315d HGB in conjunction with section 289f (1) sentence 2 of the HGB. It is \\navailable at https://www.merckgroup.com/en/investors/corporate-governance/reports.html. \\n\\nEffects of material company agreements on the net assets, financial position, \\n\\nand results of operations \\n\\nHive-down of the operating activities of the business sectors and temporary leaseback of \\nthe hived-down business activities \\n\\nAs part of the strategic further development of Merck KGaA, the existing operating activities of the Life Science, \\nHealthcare, and Electronics business sectors within Merck KGaA, together with the relevant assets and liabilities \\n(hereinafter: ”operating units”), were hived down at their carrying amounts into three separate legal entities \\n(hereinafter: ”OpCo” or plural ”OpCos”) with the legal form of a GmbH or German limited liability corporation \\nand with economic effect from January 1, 2018 (operating hive-down).  \\n\\nImmediately after the operating hive-down took effect, all the shares held by Merck KGaA in the respective \\nOpCos were transferred to holding companies via a further hive-down (holding company hive-down), as a result \\nof which the OpCos are each held indirectly by Merck KGaA via an intermediate holding company (referred to \\nindividually as “HoldCo” irrespective of the business sector and jointly as “HoldCos”).   \\n\\nSince the technical system requirements for the rollout of the business sector-specific enterprise resource \\nplanning systems (hereinafter “ERP”) were not in place at the OpCos at the time of the hive-down, the business \\nactivities hived down to the OpCos have been temporarily leased back by the relevant OpCos to Merck KGaA. \\nUnder the terms of a business lease agreement, Merck KGaA leased the entire operations from the three OpCos \\n\\n \\n \\n\\x0cCombined Management Report ___ Additional Information on Merck KGaA in Accordance with the German Commercial Code (HGB) \\n\\n188  \\n\\nwith economic effect from January 1, 2018. In this context, it also leased all fixed assets and acquired the \\ncurrent assets as well as certain liabilities and provisions at their carrying amounts under German commercial \\nlaw. Once the relevant ERP systems have been rolled out for the respective OpCo, the business lease with this \\nOpCo will be terminated and the previously leased business will be transferred to the OpCo. \\n\\nTermination of the temporary business lease of the Healthcare and Electronics business \\nsectors \\n\\nIn 2018, the Healthcare OpCo changed its legal form to that of a German corporation with general partners \\n(Kommanditgesellschaft auf Aktien) and has since been trading under the name of Merck Healthcare KGaA, \\nDarmstadt. The business leasing contract under which the Healthcare business sector was leased back to \\nMerck KGaA was terminated with economic effect from March 21, 2019. As a result of the termination of the \\nbusiness leasing contract, the leased objects allocated to the Healthcare business sector at the end of the lease \\n– comprising current assets as well as certain liabilities and provisions – were transferred to Merck Healthcare \\nKGaA at their carrying amounts under German commercial law.  \\n\\nWith the introduction of the specific ERP system for the distribution and sales function of the Electronics \\nbusiness sector on January 1, 2020, the business leasing contract between Merck Performance Materials \\nGermany GmbH and Merck KGaA for the Electronics business sector was terminated for this function with \\neconomic effect from December 31, 2019. The business leasing contract for the other functions of the \\nElectronics business sector remains in place. Accordingly, the distribution and sales function of the Electronics \\nbusiness sector moved to Merck Performance Materials Germany GmbH with economic effect from \\nJanuary 1, 2020. As a result, the contractual, process, procedural, and working relationships allocated to the \\nfunction and the leased objects allocated to the function at their carrying amounts under German commercial \\nlaw – comprising current assets as well as certain liabilities and provisions – were transferred to Merck \\nPerformance Materials Germany GmbH.  \\n\\nAs a result of the aforementioned spin-off and restructuring measures and the business leasing contract that \\nremains in place, Merck KGaA still continues to manage the operating business of the Electronics business \\nsector with the exception of part of the distribution and sales function. Furthermore, as a result of the business \\nleasing contract, Merck KGaA also runs the operating business of the Life Science business sector. \\n\\nConstruction of the Gernsheim Science and Technology Park (“Fluxum Gernsheim”)  \\n\\nAs part of the strategic development of the Gernsheim site into a science and technology park, various \\noperations at the Gernsheim site have been bundled and transferred to separate subsidiaries domiciled in \\nGernsheim. \\n\\nFirstly, this relates to the transfer of site management functions based in Gernsheim (hereinafter referred to as \\n“SM Gernsheim”) from Merck KGaA to Merck Site Management GmbH, which will act as an infrastructure \\nservice provider at the site in the future, by way of contribution. The transfer was based on the contribution \\nagreement concluded between Merck KGaA and Merck Site Management GmbH in notarized form on \\nSeptember 21/22, 2021, which took economic effect from the end of September 30, 2021. The agreement \\nprovided for the transfer of the assets and liabilities attributable to SM Gernsheim to Merck Site Management \\nGmbH at their current carrying amounts. This primarily related to the balance sheet items of fixed assets, \\ninventories, other receivables, and pension provisions, as well as the transfer of 96 employees along with the \\nassociated personnel provisions. \\n\\nSecondly, this relates to the transfer of the Gernsheim-based production operations of the Surface Solutions \\nbusiness unit within the Electronics business sector, including the Gernsheim-specific Electronics shared \\nfunctions and the Gernsheim logistics operation (hereinafter referred to collectively as “SSG Production”), by \\nway of their separation and transfer to Merck Gernsheim Holding GmbH under transformation law and their \\nsubsequent spin-off to Merck Surface Solutions GmbH with economic effect from July 1, 2021. \\n\\n \\n \\n\\x0cCombined Management Report ___ Additional Information on Merck KGaA in Accordance with the German Commercial Code (HGB) \\n\\n189  \\n\\nAs Merck Performance Materials Germany GmbH was leasing SSG Production to Merck KGaA under a business \\nleasing contract at this time, the separation involved not only the transfer of the assets and liabilities of SSG \\nProduction held by Merck Performance Materials Germany GmbH to Merck Gernsheim Holding GmbH at their \\ncurrent carrying amount, but also the transfer of the rights and obligations of Merck Performance Materials \\nGermany GmbH relating to SSG Production under the aforementioned business leasing contract (the separated \\nportion of the business leasing contract relating to SSG Production being hereinafter referred to as the “SSG \\nbusiness leasing contract”). \\n\\nImmediately after the separation took economic effect, all the assets and liabilities transferred to Merck \\nGernsheim Holding GmbH and the rights and obligations arising from the separated SSG business leasing \\ncontract were spun off to Merck Surface Solutions GmbH with economic effect from July 1, 2021.  \\n\\nAs the technical system requirements for Merck Surface Solutions GmbH to commence operations were not yet \\nfulfilled when the spin-off took place, the separated SSG business leasing contract between Merck \\nSurface Solutions GmbH and Merck KGaA continued to be implemented as previously for a brief transitional \\nperiod until the end of September 30, 2021. Merck Surface Solutions GmbH commenced operations via SSG \\nProduction with effect from October 1, 2021. As a result of the termination of the SSG business leasing \\ncontract, the leased objects allocated to SSG Production within the Electronics business sector at the end of the \\nlease – largely comprising inventories as well as certain liabilities and provisions – were transferred to Merck \\nSurface Solutions GmbH at their carrying amounts under German commercial law. The contractual, process, \\nprocedural, and working relationships (603 employees) allocated to SSG Production were also transferred to \\nMerck Surface Solutions GmbH. \\n\\nTransfer of Electronics production operations  \\n\\nTo facilitate the implementation and operation of the new ERP systems for the LS OpCo and the EL OpCo, the \\nEL OpCo transferred the Darmstadt-based “Organics” and “OLED” production operations, including the \\nproduction-related Electronics shared functions (“EL Production”), to the LS OpCo on August 31, 2022, by way \\nof a chain transformation pursuant to the German Transformation Act.     \\n\\nThe first step of the chain transformation was the hive-down by absorption to Merck Electronics Darmstadt \\nGmbH (Merck EL Darmstadt). The EL Production (ELP) hive-down became effective when it was entered in the \\ncommercial register of the EL OpCo on August 31, 2022. As ELP was leased to Merck KGaA as part of the \\noperating unit Electronics before the hive-down from the EL OpCo became effective, the ELP hive-down \\ninvolved not only the transfer of the assets and liabilities of ELP held by the EL OpCo to Merck EL Darmstadt, \\nbut also, with the approval of Merck KGaA, the transfer of the rights and obligations of the EL OpCo relating to \\nELP under the terms of the EL business lease agreement. The part of the contract that was hived down is \\nreferred to in the following as the ELP business lease agreement.   \\n\\nIn the second step of the chain transformation, all the shares in Merck EL Darmstadt that were previously held \\nby Merck Performance Materials Holding GmbH (EL HoldCo) were transferred to Merck Life Science Holding \\nGmbH by way of a hive-down by absorption (“Merck EL Darmstadt hive-down”). The Merck EL Darmstadt hive-\\ndown became effective when it was entered in the commercial register of the EL HoldCo on August 31, 2022, \\nimmediately after the ELP hive-down became effective.   \\n\\nLastly, the third step in the chain transformation involved the merger of Merck EL Darmstadt into the LS OpCo \\nby way of a merger by acquisition (“Merck EL Darmstadt merger”). The Merck EL Darmstadt merger became \\neffective when it was entered in the commercial register of the LS OpCo on August 31, 2022, immediately after \\nthe hive-down of the shares in Merck EL Darmstadt became effective. The ELP business lease agreement \\nbetween Merck KGaA as the lessee and the LS OpCo as the lessor remained in place upon the Merck EL \\nDarmstadt merger becoming effective. The chain transformation did not lead to any significant effects on the \\nnet assets, financial position and results of operations of Merck KGaA.  \\n\\nBy way of entries in the commercial register on November 1, 2022 (LS OpCo) and December 29, 2022 \\n(EL OpCo), the LS OpCo and the EL OpCo changed their legal form to that of a German corporation with general \\n\\n \\n \\n\\x0cCombined Management Report ___ Additional Information on Merck KGaA in Accordance with the German Commercial Code (HGB) \\n\\n190  \\n\\npartners (Kommanditgesellschaft auf Aktien) and have since been operating under the names Merck \\nLife Science KGaA, Darmstadt, and Merck Electronics KGaA, Darmstadt.  \\n\\nTermination of the business lease of the Life Science and Electronics business sectors \\n\\nThe LS OpCo is scheduled to go live on January 1, 2023. The power of operational management for the \\nLife Science operating business and ELP (referred to jointly as the Leased Operations) will be assumed by \\nMerck KGaA at this date. On October 31, 2022, Merck KGaA therefore terminated the business leasing contracts \\ngiving due and proper notice with effect from midnight on January 1, 2023, in accordance with the LS business \\nleasing contract and the ELP business leasing contract. The termination resulted in the transfer of around 3,400 \\nemployees from Merck KGaA to the LS OpCo and around 1,000 employees to the EL OpCo. The remaining \\naround 4,000 employees in Group functions remained with Merck KGaA. \\n\\nBusiness development \\n\\nMerck KGaA’s net sales decreased in 2022. The downturn of € 253 million was primarily attributable to the \\nHealthcare and Electronics business sectors. The net sales of the Healthcare business sector relate to Group \\nservices oncharged to other companies in the Healthcare business sector. \\n\\n€ million \\n\\nLife Science \\n\\nHealthcare \\n\\nElectronics \\n\\nOther sales \\n\\nTotal \\n\\n2022   \\n\\n1,591   \\n\\n445   \\n\\n806   \\n\\n338   \\n\\n3,180   \\n\\nChange \\n\\n2021   \\n\\n€ million   \\n\\n1,537   \\n\\n531   \\n\\n1,037   \\n\\n327   \\n\\n3,433   \\n\\n54   \\n\\n-86   \\n\\n-232   \\n\\n11   \\n\\n-253   \\n\\n% \\n\\n3.5 \\n\\n-16.2 \\n\\n-22.3 \\n\\n3.2 \\n\\n-7.4 \\n\\nOther sales mainly included the intragroup oncharging of IT services, rent, and the umbrella brand, as well as \\nother administrative services. \\n\\nThe share of sales with other Group companies (Group sales) amounted to 91.7% in the year under review \\n(2021: 91.9%). \\n\\n€ million \\n\\nGroup internal product sales \\n\\nThird party product sales \\n\\nGroup internal services \\n\\nChange \\n\\n2022   \\n\\n2021   \\n\\n€ million   \\n\\n1,548   \\n\\n265   \\n\\n1,366   \\n\\n3,180   \\n\\n1,944   \\n\\n278   \\n\\n1,211   \\n\\n3,433   \\n\\n-396   \\n\\n-13   \\n\\n155   \\n\\n-253   \\n\\n% \\n\\n-20.4 \\n\\n-4.5 \\n\\n12.8 \\n\\n-7.4 \\n\\nAt 68.7% (2021: 72.0%), the share of exports in 2022 was lower than in the previous year. \\n\\n€ million \\n\\nOutside Germany \\n\\nGermany \\n\\nTotal \\n\\nChange \\n\\n2022   \\n\\n2021   \\n\\n€ million   \\n\\n2,184   \\n\\n996   \\n\\n3,180   \\n\\n2,472   \\n\\n961   \\n\\n3,433   \\n\\n-288   \\n\\n35   \\n\\n-253   \\n\\n% \\n\\n-11.7 \\n\\n3.7 \\n\\n-7.4 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n \\n \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n \\n \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n \\n \\n   \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cCombined Management Report ___ Additional Information on Merck KGaA in Accordance with the German Commercial Code (HGB) \\n\\n191  \\n\\nNet sales in the Life Science business sector increased slightly compared with the previous year (+3.5%). This \\nwas primarily due to higher costs oncharged to subsidiaries in the Life Science business sector, especially in \\nconnection with IT services. On the other hand, product sales declined mainly as a result of the global business \\ndevelopment of the Process Solutions business unit (-12.3%); further information can be found under “Course \\nof Business and Economic Position”. Increased net sales in the Life Science Services (+0.5%) and Science and \\nLab Solutions (+10.3%) business units were not sufficient to completely offset the downturn in product sales. \\nThe decrease affected the North America, Asia-Pacific and Europe regions, whereas sales growth was recorded \\nin the regions of Latin America and the Middle East and Africa. \\n\\nNet sales in the Electronics business sector declined substantially year-on-year (-22.3%). Despite the growth in \\nOLED sales (+20.9%), net sales in the Display Solutions business unit fell by -37.6% on the back of weaker \\ndemand in end markets. The Surface Solutions business unit also recorded a double-digit downturn in sales  \\n(-44.5%). A large mid-eight-figure amount of the downturn in the Surface Solutions business unit was \\nattributable to the transfer of the operations at the Gernsheim site to a separate company, Merck \\nSurface Solutions GmbH, effective October 1, 2021.

The cost of materials in relation to sales remained \\nlargely unchanged at 39.9% (2021: 41.1%). \\n\\nThe higher level of personnel expenses was due in particular to increased pension expenses, which primarily \\nresulted from adjustments to valuation parameters to reflect changes in interest rates and inflation, as well as \\nsalary increases for employees covered by and exempt from collective agreements.

The other business sectors were expected to see a similar level of sales to fiscal 2021. \\nNet income was also expected to be the same as in the previous year. \\n\\nNet sales in the Life Science business sector increased slightly compared with the previous year (+3.5%). This \\nwas primarily due to higher costs oncharged to subsidiaries in the Life Science business sector, especially in \\nconnection with IT services. On the other hand, product sales declined mainly as a result of the global business \\ndevelopment of the Process Solutions business unit (-12.3%); further information can be found under “Course \\nof Business and Economic Position”. Increased net sales in the Life Science Services (+0.5%) and Science and \\nLab Solutions (+10.3%) business units were not sufficient to completely offset the downturn in product sales. \\nThe year-on-year decrease affected the North America, Asia-Pacific and Europe regions, whereas sales growth \\nwas recorded in the regions of Latin America and the Middle East and Africa. \\n\\nNet sales in the Healthcare business sector were down substantially on the previous year (-16.2%). This was \\ndue to lower costs oncharged to subsidiaries in the Healthcare business sector, especially in connection with IT \\nservices. \\n\\nNet sales in the Electronics business sector declined substantially year-on-year (-22.3%). Despite the growth in \\nOLED sales (+20.9%), net sales in the Display Solutions business unit fell by -37.6% on the back of weaker \\ndemand in end markets. The Surface Solutions business unit also recorded a double-digit downturn in  \\nsales (-44.5%). A large mid-eight-figure amount of the downturn in the Surface Solutions business unit was \\nattributable to the transfer of the operations at the Gernsheim site to a separate company, Merck \\nSurface Solutions GmbH, effective October 1, 2021. From a regional perspective, sales declined in Asia-Pacific \\nand Europe in particular.  \\n\\nNet income was below the forecast level due to lower net sales, higher financial and tax expenses, and higher \\nother operating expenses in particular. An increase in investment income and a reduction in the cost of \\nmaterials were not sufficient to offset this.  \\n\\nForecast for 2023 \\n\\nIn light of the termination of the business leasing contracts with Merck Life Science KGaA and Merck Electronics \\nKGaA and the continuation of the respective business operations in separate companies, these business sectors \\nare expected to see a downturn in net sales as a result of the transfer of product-related sales. The other \\nbusiness sector is expected to see a similar level of sales to 2022. \\n\\nAs in the previous year, the financing costs of the Sigma-Aldrich acquisition and the Versum Materials \\nacquisition will continue to adversely affect net income. Conversely, investment income will increase as a result \\nof the transfer of the operating businesses to Merck Life Science KGaA and Merck Electronics KGaA in particular. \\nNet income is forecast to be slightly higher than in 2022. \\n\\nMerck Financial Services GmbH, Darmstadt, will provide the company with sufficient financial resources and \\nthus ensure liquidity. \\n\\nNo risks that could jeopardize the continued existence of the company have been identified.\\n\\n \\n \\n\\x0c196  Capital Structure and Corporate Bodies of Merck KGaA \\n\\n197  Statement on Corporate Governance \\n\\n218  Report of the Supervisory Board \\n\\n223 Objectives of the Supervisory Board with respect to its Composition and \\n\\nProfile of Skills and Expertise \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cCombined Management Report ___ Capital Structure and Corporate Bodies of Merck KGaA \\n\\n196  \\n\\nCapital Structure and Corporate \\nBodies of Merck KGaA \\n\\nFurther information can be found under “Merck KGaA” in the “Statement on Corporate Governance”.\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cCorporate Governance ___ Statement on Corporate Governance \\n\\n197  \\n\\nStatement on Corporate \\nGovernance \\n\\nThe Statement on Corporate Governance contains the Declaration of Conformity, relevant \\ninformation on practices within the company, and a description of the procedures of the corporate \\nbodies, as well as targets for the percentage of positions held by women and the diversity policy. \\n\\nJoint report of the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board including \\n\\nDeclaration of Conformity \\n\\nThe German Corporate Governance Code is geared toward the conditions found in a German stock corporation \\n(“Aktiengesellschaft” or “AG”) and does not take into consideration the special characteristics of a corporation \\nwith general partners (“Kommanditgesellschaft auf Aktien” or “KGaA”) such as Merck KGaA. Given the \\nstructural differences between an AG and a KGaA, several recommendations of the German Corporate \\nGovernance Code are to be applied to a KGaA only in a modified form. Major differences between the two legal \\nforms exist in terms of liability and management. In the case of an AG, only the AG is liable as a legal entity, \\nwhereas the general partners of a KGaA also have unlimited personal liability for the company’s obligations \\n(section 278 (1) AktG). At Merck KGaA, this pertains to both E. Merck KG – which is excluded from \\nmanagement and representation pursuant to article 8 (5) of the Articles of Association – as well as to the \\nmanaging general partners who collectively make up the Executive Board of Merck KGaA. The members of the \\nExecutive Board of Merck KGaA are therefore subject to unlimited personal liability. Unlike an AG, their \\nexecutive authority is not conferred by the Supervisory Board, but rather by their status as general partners. \\nConsequently, in addition to other responsibilities typical of the supervisory board of an AG (see description of \\nthe procedures of the Supervisory Board), the supervisory board of a KGaA does not have the authority to \\nappoint the management board, draw up management board contracts, or specify the compensation of the \\nmanagement board. This legal form also involves special features with regard to the Annual General Meeting. \\nFor example, in a KGaA, many of the resolutions made require the consent of the general partners (section 285 \\n(2) AktG), including in particular the adoption of the Annual Financial Statements (section 286 (1) AktG). \\n\\nMerck KGaA applies the German Corporate Governance Code analogously where these regulations are \\ncompatible with the legal form of a KGaA. In order to enable shareholders to compare the situation at other \\ncompanies more easily, we base corporate governance on the conduct recommendations made by the \\nGovernment Commission of the German Corporate Governance Code to a broad extent and refrain from \\nadopting our own, equally permissible, code. All recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code \\nin the version dated December 16, 2019, the intent and meaning of which are applied, have been complied with \\nsince the last Declaration of Conformity in February 2022. We will continue to comply with the \\nrecommendations of the Code in the version dated April 28, 2022 in the future. \\n\\nFor a clearer understanding, the following gives a general explanation of the application of German company \\nlaw at Merck KGaA with additional references to the Annual General Meeting and shareholder rights. \\n\\nMerck KGaA  \\n\\nThe general partner E. Merck KG holds around 70% of the total capital of Merck KGaA (equity interest); the \\nshareholders hold the remainder, which is divided into shares (share capital). E. Merck KG is excluded from the \\nmanagement of business activities. The general partners with no equity interest (Executive Board) manage the \\nbusiness activities. Nevertheless, due to its substantial capital investment and unlimited personal liability, \\nE. Merck KG has a strong interest in ensuring that the businesses of Merck KGaA operate efficiently in \\ncompliance with procedures. Merck KGaA’s participation in the profit/loss of E. Merck KG in accordance with \\narticles 26 et seq. of the Articles of Association further harmonizes the interests of the shareholders and of \\n\\n \\n\\x0cCorporate Governance ___ Statement on Corporate Governance \\n\\n198  \\n\\nE. Merck KG. E. Merck KG appoints and dismisses the Executive Board. In addition, E. Merck KG has created \\nbodies – complementing the expertise and activities of the Supervisory Board – to monitor and advise the \\nExecutive Board. This applies primarily to the Board of Partners of E. Merck KG. \\n\\nBased on the provisions of the German Stock Corporation Act, the Articles of Association of Merck KGaA, and \\nthe rules of procedure of the various committees, Merck KGaA has adopted a set of rules for the Executive \\nBoard and its supervision that meet the requirements of the German Corporate Governance Code. The \\ninvestors, who bear the entrepreneurial risk, are protected as provided for by the German Corporate \\nGovernance Code. We take suggestions from the capital market on corporate governance seriously and hold \\ndiscussions with investors and shareholder representatives. \\n\\nThe General Meeting of Merck KGaA \\n\\nThe 27th Annual General Meeting of Merck KGaA was held in Darmstadt, Germany, on April 22, 2022. In \\nresponse to the Covid-19 pandemic, in 2022 the Executive Board again decided, with the approval of the \\nSupervisory Board, to hold the 2022 Annual General Meeting in virtual form, i.e., without the shareholders and \\ntheir proxies attending in person. In doing so, it exercised the option that the legislation again provided in 2022 \\nin the form of the act on mitigating the consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic in civil, insolvency, and \\ncriminal procedure law (Gesetz zur Abmilderung der Folgen der Covid-19-Pandemie im Zivil-, Insolvenz- und \\nStrafverfahrensrecht). Shareholders and shareholder representatives participated in the Annual General \\nMeeting virtually. The meeting was broadcast audiovisually on the Internet in full. At 70.34%, the proportion of \\nshare capital represented at the meeting (including postal votes) was slightly higher than in the previous year. \\nIn 2021, the proportion of share capital represented was 70.10%. The Annual General Meeting service provider \\ndoes not forward voting instructions to Merck in advance of the Annual General Meeting but keeps them in the \\nsystem until the count takes place. \\n\\nIn particular, the Annual General Meeting passes resolutions concerning the approval of the Annual Financial \\nStatements, the appropriation of net retained profit, the approval of the actions of the Executive Board \\nmembers and the Supervisory Board members, the election of the auditor, amendments to the Articles of \\nAssociation, the compensation system for the Executive Board, and the control and profit and loss transfer \\nagreements of Merck KGaA. The shareholders of Merck KGaA exercised their rights at the virtual Annual \\nGeneral Meeting using the Internet-based Annual General Meeting system and via a prior question and answer \\nprocess. Above and beyond the statutory requirements, this year shareholders were also given the opportunity \\nto submit statements on the agenda to the company prior to the Annual General Meeting. These statements \\nwere published ahead of the Annual General Meeting and were available for shareholders to view until the end \\nof the Annual General Meeting. They were able to exercise their voting rights personally, through an authorized \\nrepresentative, or through a proxy appointed by the company. The proxies were in attendance throughout the \\nduration of the Annual General Meeting. All the documents and information concerning upcoming General \\nMeetings (including a summary explanation of shareholder rights) are also posted on our website. The \\nintroductory speech by the Chair of the Executive Board was published in advance on the Internet on April \\n11, 2022, in order to make it available to interested shareholders and members of the public and thus satisfy \\nthe high transparency requirements of the Merck Group. \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cCorporate Governance ___ Statement on Corporate Governance \\n\\n199  \\n\\nDeclaration of Conformity \\n\\nIn accordance with section 161 AktG, applying the provisions of the German Corporate Governance Code \\ncorrespondingly, the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board issued the following Declaration of Conformity \\nwith the recommendations of the Government Commission of the German Corporate Governance Code: \\n\\n“Declaration of the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board of Merck KGaA on the recommendations of the \\nGovernment Commission of the German Corporate Governance Code pursuant to section 161 of the German \\nStock Corporation Act (AktG). Since the last Declaration of Conformity in February 2022, we have complied \\nwith all recommendations of the Government Commission of the German Corporate Governance Code in the \\nversion dated December 16, 2019 as published in the official section of the German Federal Gazette. \\n\\nWith regard to future compliance with the current recommendations of the Government Commission of the \\nGerman Corporate Governance Code, the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board declare the following: The \\ncompany will comply with the recommendations of the Code in the version dated April 28, 2022.” \\n\\nDarmstadt, February 2023 \\n\\nFor the Executive Board \\nsigned Belén Garijo \\n\\nFor the Supervisory Board \\nsigned Wolfgang Büchele \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cCorporate Governance ___ Statement on Corporate Governance \\n\\n200  \\n\\nInformation on corporate governance practices \\n\\nReporting \\n\\nIt is Merck KGaA’s objective to provide the latest information to all shareholders, media, financial analysts, and \\ninterested members of the public, while creating the greatest possible transparency. For this reason, Merck \\nuses a wide range of communication platforms to engage in a timely dialog with all interested parties about the \\ncompany’s situation and business changes. Merck’s principles include providing factually correct, \\ncomprehensive, and fair information. \\n\\nInformation subject to disclosure requirements, as well as information that is not, can be accessed worldwide \\non the Merck KGaA website (www.merckgroup.com), which is the company’s most important publication \\nplatform. In addition to a comprehensive financial calendar, quarterly statements and/or quarterly and half-\\nyear financial reports covering at least the past five years are available there in German and English. In line \\nwith the legal requirements, ad hoc announcements are also published on the website. These contain \\ninformation on circumstances and facts that could impact the Merck share price. \\n\\nRegular press conferences, investor meetings on the occasion of investor conferences, and roadshows offer \\nanother platform for dialog. The company presentations prepared for this purpose are also available on the \\nMerck KGaA website. In addition, the Investor Relations team is available to private and institutional investors \\nwho wish to receive further information. To ensure the greatest possible transparency, all documents \\nconcerning the General Meeting are available on the company website. Additionally, at least some parts of the \\nGeneral Meeting are generally webcast live on the Internet. The Annual General Meeting on April 22, 2022, was \\nagain held virtually and hence was webcast live on the Internet in full. \\n\\nDealing with insider information \\n\\nDealing properly with insider information is very important to us. Our Insider Committee examines the \\nexistence of insider information, ensures compliance with legal obligations, and prepares any necessary \\nmeasures. The members of the Insider Committee are appointed by the Executive Board; at least two members \\nwork in Group Legal & Compliance. The Insider Committee meets at regular intervals or when circumstances \\nrequire. The Chief Financial Officer is vested with the authority to make the final decision on handling potential \\ninsider information. \\n\\nIn order to ensure a high level of protection for insider information, the Executive Board issued internal insider \\nguidelines applicable throughout the Merck Group worldwide. The guidelines inform employees about their \\nresponsibilities under insider trading laws and give clear instructions for compliant behavior. In addition, they \\ndescribe the function of the Insider Committee in detail. Moreover, our Code of Conduct, which is binding for all \\nemployees, also contains an explicit, detailed reference to the ban on using insider information. Within the \\nscope of obligatory training courses on the Code of Conduct as well as specific training courses on insider law, \\nall employees are instructed on the key stipulations of insider trading. \\n\\nAccounting and audits of financial statements \\n\\nMerck KGaA prepares its consolidated financial statements and Combined Management Report in accordance \\nwith the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) effective at the end of the reporting period and \\nadopted by the European Union and the additional provisions of section 315e of the German Commercial Code \\n(HGB). The Consolidated Financial Statements and the Combined Management Report are prepared by the \\nExecutive Board and examined by an auditor, taking into account the German generally accepted standards for \\nthe audit of financial statements promulgated by the Institute of Public Auditors in Germany (Institut der \\nWirtschaftsprüfer, IDW). \\n\\nThe Supervisory Board commissioned KPMG AG Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft, Berlin, to audit the \\nConsolidated Financial Statements and the Combined Management Report for 2022. KPMG AG \\n\\n \\n\\x0cCorporate Governance ___ Statement on Corporate Governance \\n\\n201  \\n\\nWirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft, Berlin, is obliged to inform the Supervisory Board without delay of any grounds \\nfor disqualification or bias occurring during the audit if these cannot be immediately rectified. Additionally, the \\nauditor shall immediately report to the Supervisory Board any findings and issues that emerge during the audit \\nthat have a direct bearing upon the tasks of the Supervisory Board. The auditor shall inform the Supervisory \\nBoard or note in the audit report any circumstances determined during the audit that would render inaccurate \\nthe Declaration of Conformity made by the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board. It has also been agreed \\nwith the auditor that in order to assess whether the Executive Board has fulfilled its obligations in accordance \\nwith section 91 (2) of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG), the audit will also cover the company’s early \\nwarning risk identification system. Moreover, the auditor is required to examine and evaluate the accounting-\\nrelevant internal control system insofar as this is necessary and appropriate for assessing the accuracy of \\nfinancial reporting. \\n\\nSince 1995, KPMG AG Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft, Berlin, has been the auditing firm responsible for the \\nstatutory audit of the Annual Financial Statements and Consolidated Financial Statements of Merck KGaA. The \\nauditor responsible for auditing the Consolidated Financial Statements changes regularly. Dirk Janz is currently \\nleading the audit engagement. Mr. Janz has been the auditor in charge of the engagement since fiscal 2020. \\nKPMG AG Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft, Berlin, has assured the company that it is independent of the group \\nentities in accordance with the requirements of European law and German commercial and professional law, \\nand that it has fulfilled its other German professional responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. \\nThe Supervisory Board has found no grounds to doubt the independence of KPMG AG Wirtschaftsprüfungs-\\ngesellschaft, Berlin. Neither party identified any conflicts of interest. The Audit Committee reviews the quality of \\nthe audit, including the performance of the auditor in charge of the engagement, annually on the basis of \\nobjective indicators. \\n\\nDue to the requirement to change auditors at regular intervals, Merck KGaA must appoint a new auditor \\n(different than the current one) no later than for fiscal 2024. In fiscal 2019, the Supervisory Board of \\nMerck KGaA therefore decided to prepare a public request for tender for the audit of the Annual Financial \\nStatements and Consolidated Financial Statements of Merck KGaA, and to voluntarily change auditors for the \\nfiscal 2023 audit, earlier than required. The public request for tender was published in the German Federal \\nGazette in February 2020. Based on this request for tender, the Supervisory Board of Merck KGaA resolved at \\nits meeting on July 30, 2021, to propose to the Annual General Meeting that Deloitte GmbH \\nWirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft, Munich, be elected as the auditor of the Annual Financial Statements and \\nConsolidated Financial Statements of Merck KGaA for fiscal 2023. The Annual General Meeting followed this \\nproposal on April 22, 2022 and elected Deloitte GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft, Munich, as the auditor \\nof the Annual Financial Statements and Consolidated Financial Statements of Merck KGaA for fiscal 2023. \\n\\nFurther reports  \\n\\nThe combined management report of Merck KGaA and the Merck Group includes the compensation report and a \\ncombined non-financial declaration. The latter incorporates the non-financial declaration of the Merck Group in \\naccordance with section 315b HGB and the non-financial declaration of Merck KGaA in accordance with 289b \\nHGB and section 315b (1) HGB in conjunction with section 298 (2) HGB. It is included as a separate chapter of \\nthe management report. An overview of the information contained in the combined non-financial declaration \\ncan be found at “Topics for the non-financial statement”. In addition, Merck publishes a sustainability report \\nthat meets the requirements of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) standards and contains reports in \\naccordance with the standards published by the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the Task \\nForce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). This will be available from April 13, 2023, as an online \\nversion on the company’s website at https://www.merckgroup.com/en/sustainability-report/2022. The \\nreport on equality and equal pay pursuant to sections 21, 22 of the German Act on the Promotion of Pay \\nTransparency between Women and Men is attached to the combined management report and published in the \\ncompanies register. It is available at https://www.merckgroup.com/en/investors/corporate-\\ngovernance/reports.html. \\n\\n \\n \\n\\x0cCorporate Governance ___ Statement on Corporate Governance \\n\\n202  \\n\\nValues and compliance  \\n\\nFirst and foremost, responsible entrepreneurship means acting in accordance with the law – also known as \\ncompliance. All our activities are required to adhere to the applicable laws, regulations, and international ethical \\nstandards around the world. Compliance violations would result not only in possible legal action but also could \\nseriously compromise our reputation as an employer and business partner. \\n\\nOur Group Compliance function is responsible for the core topics: Merck’s Code of Conduct, anti-corruption and \\nanti-bribery (including healthcare compliance, third-party due diligence, transparency reporting), anti-money \\nlaundering, antitrust and conflict of interest. Group-wide and local policies, procedures, and processes are in \\nplace for these important compliance topics in order to ensure that our business activities are consistent with \\nthe relevant laws, regulations, and international ethical standards. \\n\\nOur compliance management system encompasses eight core elements and ongoing consultation with the \\nbusiness fields that make up our compliance portfolio: \\n\\nElements of our compliance program \\n\\nLiving our values together is the underlying principle of our compliance management system. The Compliance \\ndepartment adopts a specific brief in this respect. \\n\\nA global framework for ethical and legally compliant business processes serves to minimize risk. We achieve \\nthis by identifying specific compliance risks and requirements. Suitable policies and effective controls are \\nimplemented in order to reduce risk. Our goals also focus on our employees: It is up to us. This serves to \\nstrengthen employees’ sense of responsibility and accountability. We achieve this by informing employees \\nabout the applicable compliance rules and ethical standards and by giving them the responsibility for complying \\nwith these requirements. As compliance is the second line of defense against risks, it is important that we \\nconsistently safeguard what really matters. This is why we regularly monitor key indicators that allow us to \\nassess risks and the effectiveness of controls. Compliance not only contributes to company growth but also \\ncreates targeted value added by allowing us to advise the business sectors and help them to navigate the \\nrespective compliance requirements. Our advice takes into account and adapts to changing business \\nrequirements. \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cCorporate Governance ___ Statement on Corporate Governance \\n\\n203  \\n\\nBased on a corporate culture that places the fundamental company values – courage, achievement, \\nresponsibility, respect, integrity, and transparency – at the center of our entrepreneurial actions, our Code of \\nConduct (http://www.merckgroup.com/company/responsibility/en/regulations-and-guidelines/code-of-\\nconduct.pdf) helps us implement these when dealing with one another daily. \\n\\nWith its Code of Conduct, Merck has established a set of rules intended to help our employees to act \\nresponsibly and to make the right decisions in their daily work. The Code of Conduct applies to all Merck \\nemployees in all countries and at all levels of our organization. \\n\\nIt explains the company principles for dealings with business associates, shareholders, colleagues, and \\nemployees, and within the scope of our responsibility for society. Therefore, it supports all employees in acting \\nethically – not only in their dealings with one another but also outside the company. Accordingly, the Code of \\nConduct is also the main set of rules for our Compliance Program. Merck has aligned the content of its Code of \\nConduct with the Merck values and integrated important topics such as data privacy, healthcare compliance, \\nand bioethics. To Merck, compliance means observing legal and internal regulations and the basic ethical \\nprinciples anchored in the company’s values. With the Code of Conduct and the various unit-specific ethical \\ncompliance rules, the values are integrated into daily work and business practice. We also expect our business \\nassociates (e.g. customers, suppliers, distributors etc.) worldwide to accept these principles or to have their \\nown comparable principles. While supplier management ensures compliant behavior of suppliers, global \\nbusiness partner risk management encompasses the relations with sales-related business associates such as \\ndistributors and wholesalers. \\n\\nThe Compliance department monitors observance of the Code of Conduct with support from corresponding \\nmonitoring and training programs throughout the company. Suitable controls and tailored training programs \\nacross the company ensure monitoring of the Code of Conduct. All employees are called upon to report \\npotential compliance violations to their supervisor, Legal, HR, or other relevant departments or via the \\nCompliance hotline. In cooperation with Group Internal Auditing, the Compliance Office regularly reviews the \\nimplementation of Group-wide compliance measures at the subsidiaries. The audits regularly focus on the local \\ncompliance structure, the compliance measures taken, and the existence of corresponding compliance \\nguidelines and processes. \\n\\nThe Group Compliance Officer is responsible for the establishment, maintenance, and further development of \\nour global Compliance Management System. Among other things, the Group Compliance Officer and its team, \\nconsisting of a global Compliance Center of Expertise and Compliance Officers, take appropriate measures to \\nhelp lower the risk of serious compliance violations and implement the compliance program across Merck \\nglobally. Our Compliance Center of Expertise is a central body responsible for designing and structuring our \\ncompliance program in all business areas and Group functions. \\n\\nOur Group Compliance Officer reports on the status of our compliance activities, potential risks and serious \\ncompliance violations to the Executive Board and Audit Committee twice a year at a minimum. As part of our \\nregular reporting processes, we compile a comprehensive compliance and data privacy report annually for the \\nExecutive Board. This includes the status of our compliance program, continuous improvement initiatives and \\nkey figures on compliance and data privacy cases. Additionally, we prepare a mid-year update to highlight \\nongoing developments and the status of relevant projects and initiatives. \\n\\nA further focus area of the Compliance Program is ensuring legally and ethically correct dealings with medical \\nstakeholders and adhering to the transparency requirements. The Compliance organization has agreed on \\nextensive measures with the affected areas of the company in order to establish an internal framework of rules \\nas well as the corresponding processes for approving and documenting interactions with healthcare \\nprofessionals that ensure Merck complies with reporting obligations. We, of course, also ensure compliance with \\nthe respectively valid data protection regulations. \\n\\nThe importance of compliance is also reflected in the subsidiaries, which ensure via country representatives that \\ncompliance measures are implemented in the countries. Compliance tasks in the countries and on a regional \\nbasis are largely performed by full-time compliance officers. As a result, a higher level of compliance expertise \\n\\n \\n\\x0cCorporate Governance ___ Statement on Corporate Governance \\n\\n204  \\n\\nis based locally, and the growing number of tasks in all business sectors are taken into account. The compliance \\nofficers in the countries and regions report to the dedicated compliance officers for the respective business \\nsectors (Life Science, Healthcare, and Electronics). A separate responsibility was also created for Group \\nfunctions. Regular regional and global compliance meetings are held to promote the exchange of information \\nwithin the Compliance organization. This is supplemented by a global concept for local compliance forums and \\nglobal compliance committees, at which relevant compliance-related topics are discussed with senior \\nmanagement. These constitute an important element of risk assessment and quality assurance. \\n\\nNewcomer trainings are run for newly appointed compliance officers. These seminars serve to build up \\ncompliance expertise and strengthen cooperation within the Compliance organization. This Group-wide network \\nis used to steer the global Compliance Program. The Compliance organization is also involved in the relevant \\ndue diligence processes for the incorporation of new business units as well as possible divestments and \\nacquisitions, and the subsequent integration of companies. Within the scope of the global compliance program, \\na high degree of importance is given to regular compliance trainings of the Merck Compliance Training Plan, \\nwhich are conducted as web-based training courses and classroom sessions. The various training topics \\naddressed, particularly on the Code of Conduct, anti-corruption and bribery, conflicts of interest, anti-money \\nlaundering, antitrust and competition law, and healthcare compliance, serve to sensitize employees and \\nmanagement on the consequences of compliance violations. Since Merck set up a central Compliance hotline, \\nour employees and individuals outside of our company have been able to report compliance violations by \\ntelephone or via a web-based application in their respective language. The Compliance hotline is available 24 \\nhours a day, free of charge. Case numbers enable anonymous, two-way communication. The reports received \\nare individually reviewed. If a compliance violation exists, corresponding corrective measures are taken based \\non concrete action plans. If necessary, disciplinary measures are taken which can range from a simple verbal \\nwarning up to the dismissal of the employee who violated a compliance rule. Merck has set up a Compliance \\nCase Committee to guide these processes. The Compliance Case Committee consists of senior members from \\nvarious Group governance functions; they are involved in reviewing compliance violations and introducing \\ncountermeasures. The joint work in the Compliance Case Committee enables processes between the various \\nGroup functions to be optimally coordinated and designed efficiently. \\n\\nData Privacy \\n\\nGroup Data Privacy at Merck is integrated into the Group’s Compliance organization. As required by law, this \\ndepartment operates independently and without being required to follow instructions. The department regularly \\nprepares Data Privacy updates and produces a comprehensive Data Privacy report at regular intervals as part of \\nour broader compliance reporting efforts. The Group Data Privacy Officer has a team currently comprising \\naround 20 employees who work around the world as local Data Privacy Officers. Other individuals around the \\nworld also perform as local Data Privacy Officers alongside their primary activity for Merck. A Center of \\nExpertise also provides support in the form of structures and tools. \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cCorporate Governance ___ Statement on Corporate Governance \\n\\n205  \\n\\nOur Data Privacy Management System encompasses various elements of our portfolio alongside the pillars of \\npeople and communication. The portfolio is composed as follows: \\n\\nElements of our Data Privacy program \\n\\nThe Data Privacy organization has put specific guidelines in place in order to ensure that Data Privacy processes \\ncomply with the relevant regulations. The ”Group Data Privacy Policy” defines the standards according to which \\ndata is processed, stored, used, and transmitted at Merck. This enables us to provide a high level of privacy \\nwhen it comes to processing the data of our employees, contract partners, customers, suppliers, patients, \\nhealthcare practitioners, and participants in clinical trials. The statutory documentation requirements are \\nrealized in a central IT tool that also serves as the basis for key Data Privacy processes: documenting \\nprocessing activities, defining the Local Data Privacy Officers, documenting video recordings and surveillance, \\nand processing potential data privacy violations. Our understanding of Data Privacy throughout the Group is \\nbased on European legislation in particular, including the data privacy principles of the EU’s General Data \\nProtection Regulation (EU GDPR), which has been in force since May 2018. However, we also comply with and \\nimplement local data privacy regulations. \\n\\nRisk and opportunity management \\n\\nSystematic and responsible risk and opportunities management is a key aspect of corporate governance for \\nMerck. Merck’s company-wide risk management, compliance and control system is based on the “three-lines of \\ndefense” model, which describes the interlinked risk structures and responsibilities at various levels. \\n\\nAt the first level (1st line), activities (including the management of financial and non-financial risks) and the use \\nof resources are managed in line with external and internal regulations. Risks are to be prevented/recorded and \\nreduced where they could arise, i.e. at operational level. Risk owners, i.e. the heads of the business fields, the \\nmanaging directors of the Merck subsidiaries and the heads of the Group Functions, establish processes in \\naccordance with the requirements of the second level (2nd line) to ensure that risk mitigation measures can be \\nidentified, assessed, monitored and developed. Through the heads of the business fields and Group Functions, \\nplanned, actual and expected results in connection with the organization’s goals and risks are regularly \\ndiscussed with the Executive Board. \\n\\nThe second level (2nd Line) sets the framework for the design of the internal control system, the risk \\nmanagement system and the compliance management system by defining appropriate minimum requirements \\nfor governance, systems and processes to be applied in the 1st line. The specific structure of this governance is \\nrisk-based and at the discretion of the Executive Board. The Executive Board and the Audit Committee of the \\n\\n \\n \\n\\x0cCorporate Governance ___ Statement on Corporate Governance \\n\\n206  \\n\\nSupervisory Board receive regular reports on risk management, the financial internal control system and \\ncompliance. For further information on governance and the processes in place for risk management, compliance \\nmanagement and the financial internal control system, please see the “Risk and Opportunity Report” and the \\nsection “Values and compliance” in the Statement on Corporate Governance. \\n\\nAt the third level (3rd line), the Internal Auditing Group function monitors the accuracy, security, \\nappropriateness and effectiveness of existing governance and processes, internal controls and risk management \\nusing independent audits. These are covered by the risk-based annual audit plan or, in individual cases, ad-hoc \\naudits during the year. It helps the Executive Board perform its monitoring function and reports directly and \\nindependently to the Executive Board. The independence of Internal Auditing ensures that both the planning \\nand execution of its work are not subject to obstacles or bias, as well as guaranteeing unrestricted access to \\nthe persons, resources and information required. The head of Internal Auditing reports activities and results to \\nthe Executive Board at least once a quarter or, where required, on an ad hoc basis, and also reports to the \\nAudit Committee twice a year. Internal Auditing itself undergoes an external quality audit every five years. A \\nquality audit was conducted in fiscal 2022. \\n\\nThe “three-lines-of-defense” model is supplemented in terms of accounting by the activities of the external \\nauditor. With the “three-lines-of-defense” model described, the Executive Board has implemented a governance \\nframework for Merck that aims to ensure appropriate, effective internal control and risk management. The \\nmeasures put in place in this context are also designed to ensure that internal control, compliance and risk \\nmanagement are effective and appropriate and are discussed, for example, in the Risk and Opportunity Report \\nin the combined management report. Independent monitoring and audits are also carried out as part of \\nimplementing the “three-lines-of-defense” model and the statutory framework, in particular through the audits \\nby Internal Auditing described and other external audits. In particular, the pace at which requirements for non-\\nfinancial reporting and non-financial risks change makes it necessary to regularly review and, where necessary, \\nadjust the monitoring systems for this area.  \\n\\nRelevant Group functions and representatives from the business fields reported on the control systems in place \\nto the Executive Board in 2022. In this context, areas where potential for improvement and optimization had \\nbeen identified and relevant ongoing projects were also presented to the Executive Board. Finally, the individual \\nfunctions and business fields issued an assessment to the Executive Board of the appropriateness and \\neffectiveness of the control system, where applicable taking account of recommended improvement \\nopportunities. Based on this, the review of the non-financial internal control system and reporting by Internal \\nAuditing, as of December 31, 2022 the Executive Board was not aware of any indications with regard to \\nmaterial issues that the system is not appropriate or effective. Given the multi-layered process landscape and \\nthe high speed of change regarding the catalog of requirements for non-financial information, the maturity of \\nthe non-financial internal control system does not yet match that of the (Group) accounting-related internal \\ncontrol system. Based on regular reviews of the financial internal control system, compliance and risk \\nmanagement and reporting by Internal Auditing, as of December 31, 2022 the Executive Board was not aware \\nof any indications with regard to material issues that this system is not appropriate or effective.  \\n\\nAvoidance of conflicts of interest \\n\\nWithin the framework of their work, all Executive Board and Supervisory Board members of Merck KGaA are \\nexclusively committed to the interests of the company and neither pursue personal interests nor grant \\nunjustified advantages to third parties. \\n\\nBefore an Executive Board member takes on honorary offices, board positions, or other sideline activities, this \\nmust be approved by the Personnel Committee of the Board of Partners of E. Merck KG. The Chair of the \\nExecutive Board, Belén Garijo, and the Chief Financial Officer, Marcus Kuhnert, are both members of the \\nExecutive Board of E. Merck KG. This does not, however, create conflicts of interest. \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cCorporate Governance ___ Statement on Corporate Governance \\n\\n207  \\n\\nIn its report to the General Meeting, the Supervisory Board discloses any conflicts of interest involving its \\nmembers and how they were dealt with. Consultancy agreements as well as other service and work contracts of \\na Supervisory Board member with Merck require the approval of the Supervisory Board. In fiscal 2022, there \\nwere neither conflicts of interest nor consultancy agreements or other service or work contracts with \\nMerck KGaA involving Supervisory Board members. \\n\\nAdherence to environmental and safety standards \\n\\nAt Merck, environmental protection is based on closed-loop thinking and the integration of precautionary \\nmeasures into our process, procedural, and product development planning. The principles and strategies set out \\nin our Environment, Health and Safety Policy implement the guidelines formulated by the national and \\ninternational associations of the chemical industry in the Responsible Care guidelines. The Responsible Care \\nGlobal Charter developed by the International Council of Chemical Associations (ICCA) emphasizes overall \\nresponsibility for products, supply chains, and society. Merck has signed this expanded version of the \\nResponsible Care Global Charter for the entire Group. It is implemented by Merck at an international level. We \\nreport our ecological, economic, and social performance transparently in accordance with the internationally \\nrecognized principles of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI). \\n\\n•  We have set ourselves the goal of climate-neutral business operations along the entire value chain by 2040. \\nBy 2030, we intend to reduce our direct (Scope 1) and indirect (Scope 2) emissions by 50% compared with \\n2020. Our goal is to achieve this primarily by reducing process-related emissions, implementing energy \\nefficiency measures, and obtaining more electricity from renewable sources. In terms of our Scope 3 \\nemissions, we want to reduce emissions throughout the entire value chain by 52% (per € of value added) by \\n2030. These short-term targets for 2030 were approved by the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) in \\nMay 2022. The independent initiative assesses and approves companies’ targets based on its strict climate \\nscience criteria. By receiving this confirmation, we are helping limit global warming to 1.5 °C, meeting the \\nrequirements of the Paris Agreement. \\n\\n•  We are also aiming to source 80% of our purchased electricity from renewable energies by 2030. \\n\\n•  Furthermore, we intend to reduce the environmental impact of our waste by 5% between now and 2025 \\n\\n(based on our Merck Waste Score), as well as reducing water consumption by 10% by 2025 and improving \\nthe quality of our waste water by 2030. \\n\\nWe aim to lower the lost time injury rate (LTIR) to below 1 by 2025. We are also developing a Global Health \\nConcept for the entire Group. Many guidelines specify how the sites and employees of the Merck Group are to \\nobserve the principles in their daily work. The Group function Corporate Sustainability, Quality and Trade \\nCompliance steers these global activities and ensures compliance with statutory requirements, internal \\nstandards, and business needs throughout the entire Group. In this way, Group-wide risks are minimized, and \\ncontinuous improvement is promoted in the areas of environment, health, safety, security, and quality. \\nCorporate Responsibility reports are also published at regular intervals. \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cCorporate Governance ___ Statement on Corporate Governance \\n\\n208  \\n\\nProcedures of the Executive Board, Supervisory Board, Board of Partners, and \\n\\nits Committees \\n\\nMembers of the Executive Board of Merck KGaA \\n\\nInformation on memberships of statutory supervisory boards and comparable German and foreign supervisory \\nbodies (section 285 no. 10 HGB in conjunction with section 125 (1) sentence 5 AktG). \\n\\nMember \\n\\nBelén Garijo \\n\\nFrankfurt am Main, Chair \\n\\nKai Beckmann \\n\\nDarmstadt, CEO Electronics \\n\\nPeter Guenter \\n\\nBerlin, CEO Healthcare \\n\\nMatthias Heinzel \\n\\nWeinheim, CEO Life Science \\n\\nMemberships of \\n(a) statutory supervisory boards and \\n(b) comparable German and foreign supervisory bodies of corporations \\n\\n (b) • Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria S.

Merck KG, Darmstadt, Germany1 (not listed) \\n\\n2 Members delegated according to article 6 (5) of the Articles of Association. \\n\\nThe Supervisory Board performs a monitoring function. It supervises the Executive Board’s management of the \\ncompany. In comparison with the supervisory board of a German stock corporation, the role of the supervisory \\nboard of a corporation with general partners (KGaA) is limited. This is due to the fact that the members of the \\nExecutive Board are personally liable partners and therefore are responsible for the management of the \\ncompany. In particular, the Supervisory Board is not responsible for appointing and dismissing general partners \\nor for regulating the terms and conditions of their contracts. This is the responsibility of E. Merck KG. Similarly, \\nthe Supervisory Board does not have the authority to issue rules of procedure for the Executive Board or a \\ncatalog of business transactions requiring approval. This is also the responsibility of E. Merck KG (article 13 (3) \\nsentence 1 and (4) sentence 1 of the Articles of Association). \\n\\nHowever, the fact that the Supervisory Board has no possibility of directly influencing the Executive Board \\nrestricts neither its information rights nor its audit duties. The Supervisory Board must monitor the legality, \\nregularity, usefulness, and economic efficiency of the Executive Board. In particular, the Supervisory Board has \\nthe duty to examine the reports provided by the Executive Board. This includes regular reports on the intended \\nbusiness policy, as well as other fundamental issues pertaining to corporate planning, especially financial, \\ninvestment, and HR planning, the profitability of the Merck Group, and the course of business. In particular, this \\nalso includes sustainability issues. The regular reports pertaining to Group Internal Auditing, risk management, \\nthe internal control system, and compliance are now received by the Audit Committee of the Supervisory \\nBoard. In addition, by means of consultation with the Executive Board, it creates the basis for supervision of \\nthe management of the company by the Supervisory Board in accordance with section 111 (1) AktG. The \\nSupervisory Board and the Audit Committee examine the Annual Financial Statements as well as the \\nConsolidated Financial Statements and the Combined Management Report, taking into account the auditor’s \\nreports. Moreover, the Audit Committee discusses the quarterly statements and the half-year financial report, \\ntaking into account in the latter case the report of the auditor on the audit review of the abridged financial \\nstatements and the interim management report of the Group, and reports to the Supervisory Board. The \\nadoption of the Annual Financial Statements is not the responsibility of the Supervisory Board, but of the \\nAnnual General Meeting. The Supervisory Board and the Audit Committee normally meet four times a year. \\nFurther meetings may be convened if requested by a member of either the Supervisory Board or the Executive \\nBoard. As a rule, resolutions of the Supervisory Board are passed at meetings at the instruction of the Chair. In \\nexceptional cases a resolution may be passed by other means, details of which are given in the rules of procedure. \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cCorporate Governance ___ Statement on Corporate Governance \\n\\n211  \\n\\nThe members of the Board of Partners of E. Merck KG and of the Supervisory Board may be convened to a joint \\nmeeting if so agreed by the chairpersons of the two boards. \\n\\nThe Supervisory Board has adopted rules of procedure for its activities that are available on the company’s \\nwebsite at: https://www.merckgroup.com/company/who-we-are/management-and-company-\\nstructure/supervisory-board/EN/Rules-of-Procedure-Supervisory-Board-EN.pdf. \\n\\nThe rules of procedure prescribe that the Supervisory Board may form committees. The Supervisory Board has \\nformed a Nomination Committee and an Audit Committee.  \\n\\nThe Nomination Committee comprises three shareholder representatives. Its members are Wolfgang Büchele \\n(Chair), Helga Rübsamen-Schaeff, and Simon Thelen. The Nomination Committee is responsible for proposing \\nto the Supervisory Board suitable candidates for its proposal to the Annual General Meeting. In addition to the \\nlegal requirements and the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code, the objectives of the \\nSupervisory Board with respect to its composition, the profile of skills and expertise, and the diversity policy \\nmust be taken into consideration.  \\n\\nThe Audit Committee comprises three shareholder representatives and three employee representatives. The \\nmembers of the Audit Committee are Helene von Roeder (Chair), Wolfgang Büchele, Edeltraud Glänzer (until \\nMay 15, 2022) and her successor Jürgen Glaser (since May 16, 2022), Sascha Held, Christian Raabe and \\nDaniel Thelen. \\n\\nThe German Stock Corporation Act and the German Corporate Governance Code in the versions currently \\napplicable to the company state that at least one member of the Audit Committee shall have professional \\nexpertise in accounting and at least one additional member of the Audit Committee shall have professional \\nexpertise in auditing. Accounting and auditing also include sustainability reporting and auditing the \\nsustainability reports. The Chair of the Audit Committee should have professional expertise in at least one of \\nthe two areas. As financial expert, Helene von Roeder has particular knowledge and experience of the \\napplication of reporting principles and internal controls. She is also familiar with auditing and, in this context, \\nwith sustainability reporting. Her aforementioned knowledge is based, among other things, on her activities as \\na member of the Management Board of Vonovia SE, to which she belonged first as CFO and now as CTO. She is \\nalso the Chair of the Audit Committee of the company’s Supervisory Board and the Finance Committee of the \\nBoard of Partners of E. Merck KG. Helene von Roeder thus qualifies as a financial expert within the meaning of \\nSection 100 (5) of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) and Recommendation D.3 of the German \\nCorporate Governance Code. In addition, Wolfgang Büchele has expertise in the area of accounting. His \\nexpertise results from his role as CEO of Exyte GmbH, his many years as a member of the executive boards of \\nother companies, and his membership of other supervisory bodies. Wolfgang Büchele thus qualifies as a \\nfinancial expert within the meaning of Section 100 (5) of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) and \\nRecommendation D.3 of the German Corporate Governance Code. \\n\\nDefining the required knowledge in more detail, a further provision of the German Stock Corporation Act also \\nstates that the members of the Supervisory Board must be collectively familiar with the sector in which their \\ncompany operates. This requirement is addressed in the Supervisory Board’s profile of skills and expertise, \\nwhich stipulates that the Supervisory Board should have at least four members who possess such knowledge of \\nthe sector. We currently meet this requirement (see also “Objectives of the Supervisory Board with Respect \\nto Its Composition and Profile of Skills and Expertise”). Information on the independence of the shareholder \\nrepresentatives can be found under “Objectives of the Supervisory Board with Respect to its Composition \\nand Profile of Skills and Expertise.”  \\n\\nThe Supervisory Board and the Audit Committee each conducted a self-assessment in fiscal 2022. These self-\\nassessments took the form of internal efficiency reviews based on an extensive questionnaire and resulted in a \\npositive opinion on all topics. Potential improvements to further optimize the work of the committees in \\nindividual areas were disclosed and corresponding measures initiated. For more information on the Nomination \\nand Audit Committee, please refer to the “Report of the Supervisory Board”. \\n\\n \\n \\n\\x0cCorporate Governance ___ Statement on Corporate Governance \\n\\n212  \\n\\nBoard of Partners of E.

It informs itself \\nabout the business matters of Merck KGaA and may inspect and examine the company’s accounts, other \\nbusiness documents, and assets for this purpose. According to article 13 (4) of the Articles of Association of \\nMerck KGaA, the Executive Board requires the approval of E. Merck KG for transactions that are beyond the \\nscope of the Group’s ordinary business activities. For such transactions, approval must first be obtained from \\nthe Board of Partners of E.

The \\nmembers of the Board of Partners may convene a joint meeting with the Supervisory Board of Merck KGaA if so \\nagreed by the chairpersons of the two boards. \\n\\nThe Board of Partners may delegate the performance of individual duties to committees. Currently, the Board of \\nPartners has three committees in place: the Personnel Committee, the Finance Committee, and the Research \\nand Development Committee. \\n\\nPersonnel Committee \\n\\nThe Personnel Committee has four members: Johannes Baillou (Chair), Wolfgang Büchele, Michael Kleinemeier, \\nand Frank Stangenberg-Haverkamp. The Personnel Committee meets at least twice a year. Further meetings \\nare convened as and when necessary. Meetings of the Personnel Committee are attended by the Chair of the \\nExecutive Board of Merck KGaA unless the Committee decides otherwise. Among other things, the Personnel \\nCommittee is responsible for the following decisions concerning members and former members of the Executive \\nBoard: contents and conclusion of employment contracts and pension contracts; granting of loans and salary \\nadvances; changes to the compensation structure and adaptation of compensation; approval for taking on \\nhonorary offices, board positions, and other sideline activities; and division of responsibilities within the \\nExecutive Board of Merck KGaA. The Personnel Committee passes its resolutions by a simple majority; in \\nmatters concerning the Chair of the Executive Board, unanimity is required. The Chair of the Committee \\nregularly informs the Board of Partners of its activities. \\n\\nFinance Committee \\n\\nThe Finance Committee has five members: Helene von Roeder (Chair), Johannes Baillou, Wolfgang Büchele, \\nDaniel Thelen, and Simon Thelen. The Finance Committee holds at least four meetings a year, some of which \\nare joint meetings with the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board of Merck KGaA. At least one meeting is a \\njoint meeting with the auditor of Merck KGaA. Further meetings are convened as and when necessary. Meetings \\nof the Finance Committee are attended by the Chief Financial Officer of Merck KGaA. Other members of the \\nExecutive Board of Merck KGaA may attend the meetings upon request of the Finance Committee. These \\nmeetings regularly include the Chair of the Executive Board. Among other things, the Finance Committee is \\nresponsible for analyzing and discussing the Annual Financial Statements, the Consolidated Financial \\nStatements, and the respective reports of the auditor, as well as the half-year financial report and the quarterly \\nstatements. In addition, the Finance Committee addresses Merck’s net assets, financial position, results of \\noperations, and liquidity, as well as accounting issues. Upon request of the Board of Partners, the Finance \\nCommittee examines investment projects that must be approved by the Board of Partners and provides \\nrecommendations pertaining thereto. It passes its resolutions with a simple majority. The Chair of the \\nCommittee regularly informs the Board of Partners of the activities of the Finance Committee. \\n\\nResearch and Development Committee \\n\\nThe Research and Development Committee has four members: Helga Rübsamen-Schaeff (Chair), Johannes \\nBaillou, Katharina Kraft, and Simon Thelen. The Research and Development Committee is convened as and \\nwhen necessary but holds at least two meetings a year. Meetings of the Research and Development Committee \\nare attended by members of the Executive Board of Merck KGaA upon request of the Committee. These \\nmeetings regularly include the Chair of the Executive Board as well as the CEO Life Science, the CEO \\nHealthcare, and the CEO Electronics. Among other things, the Research and Development Committee is \\nresponsible for reviewing and discussing the research activities of the Life Science, Healthcare, and Electronics \\nbusiness sectors. It passes its resolutions with a simple majority. The Chair of the Committee reports to the \\nBoard of Partners on the insights gained from the meetings. \\n\\n \\n\\x0cCorporate Governance ___ Statement on Corporate Governance \\n\\n214  \\n\\nStipulations to promote the percentage of management positions held by \\n\\nwomen pursuant to section 76 (4) and section 111 (5) of the German Stock \\n\\nCorporation Act (AktG) \\n\\nStipulations pursuant to section 76 (4) AktG (target for the percentage of positions held \\nby women on the two upper management levels below the Executive Board) \\n\\nWe foster diversity within the company, which also includes ensuring a balance of genders in management. To \\nthis end, we pursue both voluntary and legally required objectives, and we work continuously and sustainably \\nto achieve them. As a global company with correspondingly aligned global (leadership) structures, we are \\nstriving to increase the proportion of management positions held by women (managers, experts, and project \\nmanagers in roles 4 and above)1 as a voluntary goal. Our aim is to achieve gender parity by the end of 2030. \\n\\nIn addition, Merck KGaA is subject to the statutory obligations under section 76 (4) AktG. \\n\\nOn December 21, 2021, the Executive Board of Merck KGaA therefore set the new targets to be achieved by \\nDecember 31, 2024, in order to implement the obligations under section 76 (4) AktG as follows:  \\n\\n•  First management level of Merck KGaA below the Executive Board: 35.5% of positions held by women, \\n\\ncorresponding to full headcounts at the date on which the targets were defined \\n\\n•  Second management level of Merck KGaA below the Executive Board: 31.8% of positions held by women, \\n\\nalso corresponding to full headcounts at the date on which the targets were defined. \\n\\nThe first management level comprises all managers of Merck KGaA with a direct reporting line to the Executive \\nBoard of Merck KGaA or who belong to the Global Executive Group. The second management level comprises all \\nmanagers of Merck KGaA who report to managers with a direct reporting line to the Executive Board of \\nMerck KGaA or the Global Executive Group. \\n\\nStipulations pursuant to section 111 (5) AktG (target for the percentage of positions on \\nthe Supervisory Board held by women)  \\n\\nPursuant to section 111 (5) AktG, the Supervisory Board of companies that are listed or subject to \\ncodetermination must stipulate binding targets for the percentage of positions on the Supervisory Board and on \\nthe Management Board held by women. However, Merck KGaA is not required to stipulate targets pursuant to \\nsection 111 (5) AktG for the following reasons:  \\n\\nThe statutory target of 30% pursuant to section 96 (2) AktG is already applied to the Supervisory Board of \\nMerck KGaA; this eliminates the obligation to stipulate a further target for the percentage of positions held by \\nwomen on the Supervisory Board (see section 111 (5) sentence 5 AktG).  \\n\\nIn turn, the obligation to stipulate a target for the percentage of positions held by women on the Executive \\nBoard pursuant to section 111 (5) AktG and the minimum composition requirement for the Executive Board \\npursuant to section 76 (3a) AktG are not applicable to the legal form of a corporation with general partners \\n(Kommanditgesellschaft auf Aktien), as a corporation with general partners neither has a management board \\ncomparable to that of a stock corporation, nor does the Supervisory Board have personnel authority over the \\nExecutive Board. Rather, the Executive Board of Merck KGaA consists of personally liable general partners (see \\nalso the description of Supervisory Board procedures). In line with its diversity policy, however, Merck also \\ncontinues to pursue representation of both genders as an objective for the Executive Board. \\n\\n1 This group makes up around 7% of the total workforce; see the description under “Diversity and management”. \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cCorporate Governance ___ Statement on Corporate Governance \\n\\n215  \\n\\nDiversity policy pursuant to section 289f (2) No. 6 of the German Commercial \\n\\nCode (HGB) \\n\\nMerck is pursuing a Group-wide, global diversity strategy. At Merck, diversity stands for a culture of inclusion, \\nmutual esteem, and respect. To demonstrate this open and dynamic company culture, we promote diversity, \\nequal opportunity, and inclusion throughout the Group – and do so at all levels, including the Executive Board \\nand Supervisory Board. \\n\\nWe believe that a diverse workforce boosts the innovative strength of the Merck Group and contributes \\nmaterially to our business success. That is why we are furthering a culture of diversity independent of factors \\nsuch as age, gender, disability, ethnic or cultural background, religion, industry experience, and educational \\nbackground. As part of our global diversity strategy, we have developed a diversity policy to strategically steer \\nthe topics of diversity and inclusion in our corporate bodies; this focuses on the following key criteria: \\n\\nOur Group-wide diversity strategy encompasses both voluntary as well as legally defined objectives that we \\ncontinuously and sustainably work to achieve (see also the “Diversity and Inclusion” section of the Non-\\nFinancial Statement and the Sustainability Report for 2022). In this context, it should be noted that, with \\nrespect to the Executive Board of Merck KGaA, many rules can only be applied correspondingly. This is because \\nthe Executive Board comprises personally liable general partners of Merck KGaA and is not a management \\nboard with employed members of a corporate body (for details, please also see the “Joint Report of the \\nExecutive Board and the Supervisory Board”). \\n\\nIn addition to the aspects presented below, reference is made to the objectives of the Supervisory Board with \\nrespect to its composition and the profile of skills and expertise of the Supervisory Board (see the information on \\nthe “Objectives of the Supervisory Board with respect to its composition and profile of skills and expertise”). \\nThe statements made therein form part of the diversity policy for the Supervisory Board presented here. \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cCorporate Governance ___ Statement on Corporate Governance \\n\\n216  \\n\\nAge \\n\\nOur boards are to have a balanced age structure. This permits future-oriented and consistent succession \\nplanning and is a key element of sustainable company management and monitoring. Maximum age limits apply \\nto both boards. A maximum age of 70 applies to members of the Executive Board, while the standard age limit \\nfor Supervisory Board members is 75. Our diversity policy aims for an age range of at least ten years between \\nthe youngest and the oldest member of the respective board. \\n\\nWith an age range of over 35 years, the current composition of the Supervisory Board satisfies this objective. \\nThe age range of the Executive Board is currently eight years. \\n\\nGender \\n\\nGender diversity also plays a crucial role, since it enables us to benefit from a larger talent pool and allows us \\nto develop a better understanding of important customer groups as a company. \\n\\nAdditionally, Merck continues to pursue representation of both genders as an objective for the Executive Board. \\nThe Board of Partners of E. Merck KG appointed Belén Garijo, former CEO of Healthcare and Vice Chair of the \\nExecutive Board, as the new Chair of the Executive Board effective May 1, 2021, making it the first time a \\nwoman has been appointed to these positions. The statutory target of 30% pursuant to section 96 (2) AktG \\nalready applies to the Supervisory Board of Merck KGaA and is currently met. \\n\\nInternationality and global mindset \\n\\nAs a science and technology company with global operations and major markets on five continents with more \\nthan 64,000 employees1 at locations in 662 countries, internationality and the associated global mindset is one \\nof our key success factors. According to our diversity policy, the Executive Board’s internationality derives from \\nleadership experience or national origin, relative to our key sales markets or those locations that are \\norganizationally and culturally relevant to our employee development efforts. For both criteria, Europe, North \\nAmerica, and Asia-Pacific are currently the key regions. \\n\\nThe Executive Board meets this objective with management experience in these regions, e.g., in the following \\ncountries: Denmark, Spain, the United States, Singapore, and Malaysia. In addition, more than one-third of the \\nExecutive Board members are not German citizens. \\n\\nManagement experience \\n\\nThe key prerequisites for high-performance leadership teams are the diversity of the individual competency \\nprofiles and a balance between an internal and external management perspective. Therefore, the Executive \\nBoard as a whole must have in-depth knowledge and experience in the following key areas of importance to the \\ncompany: strategy and planning, finance and accounting, sales and operations, human resources, legal and \\ncompliance, and information technology, as well as ecological and social sustainability. In addition, it is \\nimportant for the composition of the Executive Board to ensure a good balance of members from within and \\noutside the company. Our diversity policy seeks to derive inspiration and innovation from outside the company \\nand to identify the latest trends of relevance to the core businesses of the company, while ensuring \\nsustainability and continuity in line with our corporate culture. \\n\\n1 Merck also has employees at sites that are not fully consolidated subsidiaries. These figures refer to all people directly employed by Merck and therefore may \\ndeviate from figures in the financial section of this report. \\n2 Each country with at least one active employee is included as a separate country. \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cCorporate Governance ___ Statement on Corporate Governance \\n\\n217  \\n\\nThe current Executive Board fulfills both of the aforementioned objectives: All required aspects of the \\ncompetency profile are covered by at least one member of the Executive Board. Likewise, two members of the \\nExecutive Board possess multiple years of experience working within the Merck Group prior to their \\nappointment to the Executive Board. \\n\\nIndustry experience \\n\\nTo efficiently lead and manage the Group, the Executive Board must have in-depth knowledge of the key \\nindustries and business sectors in which the company operates. For each of the areas Life Science, Healthcare, \\nand Electronics, there should be at least one member of the Executive Board with in-depth expertise in \\naccordance with the diversity concept. \\n\\nThe Executive Board covers the full range of the necessary industry experience. \\n\\nEducational background \\n\\nIn order to translate the tremendous innovative potential of a science and technology company into sustainable \\nbusiness success, interdisciplinary educational backgrounds are a key element of our diversity policy both for \\nthe Executive Board and for the Supervisory Board. The current composition of both boards illustrates this \\ninterdisciplinary aspect to a very high degree. \\n\\nThe members of the Executive Board contribute knowledge of various fields including economic sciences, \\nmedicine (pharmacology, physical education), information technology, and electrical engineering. In addition, \\nthe majority of members of the Executive Board hold a university and doctorate degree. \\n\\nMoreover, the members of the Supervisory Board have a background in one or more of the following fields of \\nspecialization: chemistry, pharmaceutics, mathematics, law, human medicine, business administration and \\neconomics, physics, education, and computer sciences, among others. \\n\\nSeven Supervisory Board members are university graduates and hold doctorates. \\n\\n \\n\\x0cCorporate Governance ___ Report of the Supervisory Board \\n\\n218  \\n\\nReport of the Supervisory Board \\n\\nThe Supervisory Board again properly executed its duties in 2022 in accordance with the law as well as the \\ncompany’s Articles of Association and rules of procedure. In particular, the Supervisory Board monitored the \\nwork of the Executive Board diligently and regularly. \\n\\nCooperation with the Executive Board \\n\\nThe cooperation with the Executive Board was characterized by an intensive dialog on the basis of mutual trust. \\nDuring fiscal 2022, the Executive Board provided the Supervisory Board with regular written and verbal reports on \\nthe business development of Merck KGaA and the Merck Group. In particular, the Supervisory Board was informed \\nabout the current and potential impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, the market and sales situation of the company \\nin the context of macroeconomic developments, and the financial position of the company and its subsidiaries, \\nalong with their earnings development and corporate planning. Within the scope of quarterly reporting, the sales \\nand operating results were presented for the Merck Group as a whole and broken down by business sector. In \\naddition to the Supervisory Board meetings, the Chair of the Supervisory Board also maintained, and continues to \\nmaintain, a regular exchange of information with the Chair of the Executive Board. \\n\\nKey topics of the Supervisory Board meetings \\n\\nFour Supervisory Board meetings were held in fiscal 2022, one of which was held as a video conference. At \\nthese meetings, the Supervisory Board intensely discussed the reports of the Executive Board, as well as \\ncompany developments and strategic issues together with the Executive Board. The Chair of the Audit \\nCommittee reported comprehensively on the previous meetings of the Audit Committee at all the meetings of \\nthe Supervisory Board. \\n\\nAt the meeting in February 2022, which was held as a video conference due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, \\nthe Executive Board began by intensively addressing the Annual Financial Statements and Consolidated \\nFinancial Statements for 2021, the Combined Management Report, the reports of the auditor, including the \\naudit report on the non-financial declaration for fiscal 2021, and the proposal for the appropriation of net \\nretained profit. The auditor explained the audit reports including the focus areas of the audit. The Executive \\nBoard and the Head of Group Accounting reported on the financial statements. Furthermore, the Supervisory \\nBoard resolved on the report and the objectives of the Supervisory Board with respect to its composition and \\nthe profile of skills and expertise, the Declaration of Conformity with the German Corporate Governance Code, \\nand the Statement on Corporate Governance. The Supervisory Board also adopted the proposals to be made to \\nthe Annual General Meeting and approved the plan to again hold the Annual General Meeting in virtual form in \\nlight of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. The Executive Board reported on business performance in 2021 and \\npresented the plans for fiscal 2022 as well as the positive expectations for Merck’s global business in spite of \\nthe volatile nature of the Covid-19 pandemic, which it discussed in detail with the Supervisory Board. Cyber \\nsecurity and the arrangements taken to ensure it were also discussed. The Supervisory Board intensively \\naddressed the new organization for combating cyber threats. \\n\\nThe meeting in May 2022, which was held in person, focused on the report of the Executive Board on business \\nperformance in the first quarter and the updated forecast for fiscal 2022. The Executive Board discussed \\ndevelopments in the first quarter of 2022 and provided an outlook concerning expected business performance \\nin 2022 as a whole. The Supervisory Board extensively discussed the contributions of the individual business \\nsectors to the positive financial performance. The report of the Research and Development Committee of the \\nBoard of Partners of E. Merck KG for Life Science/Electronics was an additional focus of the meeting. Finally, the \\nSupervisory Board discussed the topic of sustainability, which is a strategic priority for the company and a \\ncritical factor in its success. \\n\\n \\n\\x0cCorporate Governance ___ Report of the Supervisory Board \\n\\n219  \\n\\nAt the meeting in July 2022, which was held in person, the Executive Board began by reporting on the \\nsuccessful business performance in the second quarter of 2022 in spite of the challenging global environment. \\nThe non-financial statement, which forms part of the management report, was a further topic of discussion. The \\nSupervisory Board resolved to commission the auditor to conduct a limited assurance review of the non-\\nfinancial declaration for fiscal 2022. The meeting also discussed the restructuring of the financial controlling \\nprocess. The planned changes were presented and explained by the Chief Financial Officer. The Supervisory \\nBoard also intensively addressed business development in China. \\n\\nAt the fourth Supervisory Board meeting in November 2022, which was also held in person, the Executive \\nBoard began by providing an overview of business performance in the third quarter of 2022, which saw Merck \\nachieving organic sales growth even in a challenging environment. The background of this positive business \\nperformance was then discussed in detail by the Supervisory Board. Other topics discussed included the report \\nby the Research and Development Committee for Healthcare and Merck KGaA’s transactions with related \\nparties within the meaning of section 111a et seq. of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG). There were no \\ntransactions requiring the approval of the Supervisory Board in accordance with section 111b (1) AktG. This \\nwas followed by an overview and an intensive discussion of the Group and business sector strategies, also in \\nthe context of external developments. The Chair of the Executive Board also reported on the Global Executive \\nConference, at which Merck managers discussed the geopolitical environment and its impact on Merck as well \\nas the priorities of the Merck Group. Finally, the Supervisory Board addressed the self-assessment and its \\nprofile of skills and expertise.  \\n\\nIn parts of its meetings, the Supervisory Board regularly meets without the members of the Executive Board \\nbeing present. Additionally, the employee representatives gather for a preparatory meeting ahead of each \\nSupervisory Board meeting. The employee representatives also gather immediately after each Supervisory \\nBoard meeting to discuss the topics addressed at the meeting. Among other things, this includes a discussion of \\nwhich topics should be placed on the agenda for the next Supervisory Board meeting. \\n\\nAnnual Financial Statements \\n\\nThe Annual Financial Statements of Merck KGaA, the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Merck Group, \\nand the Combined Management Report for Merck KGaA and the Merck Group, including the accounts, were \\naudited by KPMG AG Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft, Berlin. \\n\\nThe auditors issued an unqualified audit opinion on the Annual Financial Statements of Merck KGaA in \\naccordance with German Auditing Standards. \\n\\nFor the Consolidated Financial Statements prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting \\nStandards and for the Combined Management Report, the auditors issued the unqualified auditor’s report that \\nis reproduced in the Annual Report of the Merck Group. \\n\\nIn addition, the auditor audited the calculation of Merck KGaA’s participation in the profit of E. Merck KG in \\naccordance with Article 27 (2) of the Articles of Association, as well as the separate combined non financial \\n(Group) report. The Annual Financial Statements of Merck KGaA, the Consolidated Financial Statements of the \\nMerck Group, and the Combined Management Report for Merck KGaA and the Merck Group, including the  \\nnon-financial declaration and the proposal of the Executive Board for the appropriation of net retained profit, \\nwere submitted firstly to the Audit Committee and then to the Supervisory Board together with the auditor’s \\nreports. \\n\\nThe Audit Committee assessed the Annual Financial Statements of Merck KGaA, the proposal for the \\nappropriation of net retained profit, and the auditor’s report. It also examined the Consolidated Financial \\nStatements of the Merck Group as well as the Combined Management Report for Merck KGaA and the Merck \\nGroup, including the non-financial declaration, and took note of the auditor’s reports of KPMG AG \\nWirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft, Berlin. In particular, it focused on the key audit matters of particular \\nimportance in the audit opinion, the resulting risks for the financial statements, the approach adopted during \\n\\n \\n\\x0cCorporate Governance ___ Report of the Supervisory Board \\n\\n220  \\n\\nthe audit as described, and the conclusions drawn by the auditor. On completion of its assessment, the Audit \\nCommittee raised no objections and thus recommended that the Supervisory Board approve the Annual \\nFinancial Statements for Merck KGaA, the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Merck Group, the Combined \\nManagement Report of Merck KGaA and the Merck Group prepared by the Executive Board, and the report \\npresented by the auditor in accordance with Article 27 (2) of the Articles of Association. \\n\\nAt its meeting in February 2023 to approve the financial statements, the Supervisory Board also assessed the \\nAnnual Financial Statements of Merck KGaA, the proposal for the appropriation of net retained profit, the \\nauditor’s report presented in accordance with Article 27 (2) of the Articles of Association, the Consolidated \\nFinancial Statements of the Merck Group, and the Combined Management Report of Merck KGaA and the Merck \\nGroup in accordance with Article 14 (2) of the Articles of Association, and took note of the auditor’s reports of \\nKPMG AG Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft, Berlin. The discussion of the relevant agenda item at this meeting \\nwas also attended by the auditors who sign the audit opinion on the Annual Financial Statements of \\nMerck KGaA and the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Merck Group. This was also the case for the \\nmeeting of the Audit Committee. Based on the recommendation of the Audit Committee and its own review, the \\nSupervisory Board approved the Annual Financial Statements for Merck KGaA, the Consolidated Financial \\nStatements of the Merck Group, the Combined Management Report of Merck KGaA and the Merck Group \\nprepared by the Executive Board, and the report presented by the auditor in accordance with Article 27 (2) of \\nthe Articles of Association. The Supervisory Board gave its consent to the proposal of the Executive Board for \\nthe appropriation of net retained profit after conducting its own review. \\n\\nCorporate governance and Declaration of Conformity \\n\\nCorporate governance is a high-priority topic for the Supervisory Board. We take investor suggestions on this \\nmatter extremely seriously. In its own estimation, the Supervisory Board has an adequate number of \\nindependent members. There were no conflicts of interest as defined by the German Corporate Governance \\nCode involving Supervisory Board members during the year under review. In fiscal 2022, the Chair of the \\nSupervisory Board was prepared to hold talks with investors on topics pertaining to the Supervisory Board as \\nappropriate and remains willing to do so. The Chair of the Supervisory Board conducted an investor discussion \\nwith Allianz Global Investors GmbH in fiscal 2022. In particular, the topics discussed included the profile of skills \\nand expertise and the independence of the Supervisory Board with a view to the Supervisory Board election in \\n2024 and the transparency of the remuneration report. The Chair of the Supervisory Board stated that the \\nprofile of skills and expertise would play a significant role in the election of future candidates and that an even \\ngreater focus had been placed on sustainability and digitalization since the last election. Independence, \\noverboarding internationality and diversity are other important factors. The Supervisory Board intends to begin \\nthe search at an early stage and make use of internal and external resources in order to find the most qualified \\nand suitable candidates possible. Discussing Merck’s remuneration report, the Chair of the Supervisory Board \\nnoted the continuous improvement in the transparency of the reports from year to year. With regard to \\nsustainability in the Supervisory Board, the Chair of the Supervisory Board said that reporting-relevant topics \\nsuch as the EU taxonomy are matters for the Audit Committee in particular, while sustainability is an \\noverarching topic for the entire Supervisory Board, meaning that it is discussed at Supervisory Board meetings \\nand is the subject of specific training. \\n\\nThe Supervisory Board has an onboarding process aimed at enabling the quick and efficient induction of new \\nmembers. Most recently, Birgit Biermann received corresponding training upon joining the Supervisory Board. \\n\\nThe Supervisory Board also conducted a self-assessment in fiscal 2022. The self-assessment of the Supervisory \\nBoard took the form of an internal efficiency review based on an extensive questionnaire and resulted in a \\npositive opinion on all topics. Potential improvements to further optimize the work of the committees in \\nindividual areas were disclosed and corresponding measures initiated. The next self-assessment of the \\nSupervisory Board is scheduled for 2024. \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cCorporate Governance ___ Report of the Supervisory Board \\n\\n221  \\n\\nAfter discussing corporate governance issues in detail, the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board adopted \\nthe updated Declaration of Conformity in accordance with section 161 AktG and issued it jointly in February \\n2023. The statement is permanently available on the website of Merck KGaA (www.merckgroup.com/en/ \\ninvestors/corporate governance/reports.html). More information about corporate governance at \\nMerck KGaA, including the compensation of the Executive Board and Supervisory Board, can be found in the \\nStatement on Corporate Governance. \\n\\nCommittees \\n\\nThe Supervisory Board of Merck KGaA had a Nomination Committee and an Audit Committee in fiscal year \\n2022. The members of the Nomination Committee did not convene in fiscal 2022. \\n\\nThe Audit Committee meets four times a year. Further meetings are convened as and when necessary. The \\nAudit Committee is generally responsible for accounting and auditing matters. This includes sustainability \\nreporting and auditing the sustainability reports. In particular, its responsibilities include auditing the Annual \\nFinancial Statements, the Consolidated Financial Statements, and the respective reports of the auditor, as well \\nas the half-year financial report and the quarterly statements. The Audit Committee discusses the assessment \\nof audit risk, the audit strategy and audit planning, and the results of the audit with the auditor. The Chair of \\nthe Audit Committee regularly discusses the progress of the audit with the auditor and reports back to the \\ncommittee. The other responsibilities of the Audit Committee include assessing the performance of the auditor, \\nand especially the performance of the auditor in charge of the engagement.  \\n\\nThe Audit Committee prepares the negotiations and resolutions of the Supervisory Board on the approval of the \\nAnnual Financial Statements and Consolidated Financial Statements and the proposal to the Annual General \\nMeeting on the election of the auditor. The adoption of the Annual Financial Statements is not the responsibility \\nof the Audit Committee or the Supervisory Board but of the Annual General Meeting. The Audit Committee also \\nascertains the independence of the auditor, assigns the audit mandate to the auditor, and determines the focus \\nareas of the audit and the fee agreement. Furthermore, the Audit Committee monitors the accounting process, \\nthe effectiveness of the internal control system, the risk management system and the internal auditing system, \\nand compliance. The Chair of the Audit Committee and the auditor also engage in a regular dialog outside of \\nthe meetings of the Audit Committee. \\n\\nAt the meeting in February 2022, which was held as a video conference, the Chief Financial Officer and the \\nHead of Group Accounting reported on the 2021 Consolidated Financial Statements and the Annual Financial \\nStatements of Merck KGaA, which were then discussed in detail by the Audit Committee. This included a \\ndiscussion of the sustainability topics contained in the non-financial statement. The auditor also reported on the \\naudit of the financial statements and discussed the focus areas of the audit. The declaration of auditor \\nindependence was acknowledged and evaluated. The meeting also reviewed and resolved on the proposal on \\nthe appropriation of net retained profit to be submitted to the Supervisory Board, including the dividend \\npayment by Merck KGaA for fiscal 2021. Furthermore, the Audit Committee acknowledged and discussed the \\nwritten risk report. Based on an assessment of the quality of the previous audits, it also resolved to recommend \\nthat the Supervisory Board of Merck KGaA propose to the Annual General Meeting of Merck KGaA that KPMG \\nAktiengesellschaft Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft, Berlin, be elected as the auditor of the Annual Financial \\nStatements and Consolidated Financial Statements for fiscal 2022 and as the auditor responsible for conducting \\nthe audit review of the abridged financial statements and interim management report included in the half-year \\nfinancial report as of June 30, 2022. Additionally, it resolved to recommend that the Supervisory Board propose \\nthe resolution of authorized capital to the 2022 Annual General Meeting. The Head of Group Internal Auditing \\nthen presented the report from Group Internal Auditing for 2021. The compliance and data protection report \\nwas also presented and discussed.  \\n\\nThe report on the net assets, financial position, and results of operations of the Merck Group for the first \\nquarter of 2022 was presented to the meeting in May 2022, which was held in person. The Audit Committee \\nthen discussed the report in detail.  \\n\\n \\n\\x0cCorporate Governance ___ Report of the Supervisory Board \\n\\n222  \\n\\nThe meeting of the Audit Committee in July 2022, which was also held in person, began with a detailed \\ndiscussion of the report on the net assets, financial position, and results from operations of the Merck Group for \\nthe second quarter of 2022. The auditor then presented its half-year financial report, including a reference to \\nthe updated version of the German Corporate Governance Code (GCGC). Next, the Audit Committee resolved \\non the list of the individual audit and non-audit related services. A further focal point was the report on the key \\ndevelopments regarding the accounting-related internal control system (ICS), which the Audit Committee \\ndiscussed in detail. The Audit Committee then discussed the planned changes to the financial controlling \\nprocess in detail. This was followed by the risk management status report for the first half of 2022. \\n\\nAt the meeting in November 2022, which was held in person, the Chief Financial Officer and the Head of Group \\nAccounting reported on the net assets, financial position, and results of operations of the Merck Group in the \\nthird quarter of 2022. The income statement showed substantial sales growth compared with the same period \\nof the previous year, which represented a considerable success in light of the difficult environment. The Audit \\nCommittee discussed the report on the third quarter in detail. It then reviewed the contractual terms for the \\nannual audit of the financial statements and evaluated the audit of the financial statements and non-audit \\nservices following an extensive presentation by the Head of Group Accounting. Next, the planned scope of the \\naudit of the financial statements was discussed with KPMG AG on the basis of the statutory provisions and the \\ndefined schedule. The company’s internal control system was a further topic of discussion. In particular, this \\nincluded a discussion of the IT systems used to support financial reporting. Next, the report on Group Internal \\nAuditing and compliance and data protection was presented. Finally, the very positive results of the self-\\nassessment by the Audit Committee were presented. \\n\\nPersonnel matters and training \\n\\nThe Supervisory Board attended all the meetings in full. Edeltraud Glänzer attended the meetings in February \\nand May prior to stepping down from the Supervisory Board, while Birgit Biermann attended the meetings in \\nJuly and November after joining the Supervisory Board. The members of the Audit Committee attended all \\nmeetings of the Audit Committee. Edeltraud Glänzer attended the meetings in February and May, while her \\nsuccessor, Jürgen Glaser, attended the meetings in July and November.   \\n\\nThe members of the Supervisory Board participated in a training on the implementation of the German Supply \\nChain Due Diligence Act and on sustainability. \\n\\nDarmstadt, February 2023 \\n\\nThe Supervisory Board of Merck KGaA \\n\\nWolfgang Büchele \\n\\nChair \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cCorporate Governance ___ Objectives of the Supervisory Board with respect to its Composition and Profile of Skills and Expertise \\n\\n223  \\n\\nObjectives of the Supervisory \\nBoard with respect to its \\nComposition and Profile of Skills \\nand Expertise \\n\\nInitial situation \\n\\nAccording to recommendation C.1 of the German Corporate Governance Code in the version dated \\nApril 28, 2022, the Supervisory Board shall specify concrete objectives regarding its composition as well as \\nprepare a profile of skills and expertise for the entire board. In its composition, the Supervisory Board shall \\ntake into account the number of independent members, consider the principle of diversity, specify an age limit, \\nand disclose the term of Supervisory Board membership. The profile of skills and expertise for the Supervisory \\nBoard shall also comprise expertise regarding sustainability issues relevant to the enterprise.  \\n\\nGeneral notes on the composition of the Supervisory Board \\n\\nThe Supervisory Board of Merck KGaA currently comprises 16 members, of whom eight represent the \\nshareholders and a further eight represent the employees. The eight employee representative members are \\nelected by employee delegates pursuant to the provisions of the German Co-determination Act (MitbestG). \\nThese consist of six company employees, including a senior executive, as well as two union representatives. \\nThe Supervisory Board has no statutory right of proposal with respect to the election of delegates or employee \\nrepresentatives to the Supervisory Board. Two of the eight shareholder representatives are appointed under a \\ndelegation right of E. Merck Beteiligungen KG. The Supervisory Board also has no statutory right of proposal \\nwith respect to the exercise of this delegation right. The other six shareholder representatives are elected by \\nthe Annual General Meeting. In accordance with section 124 (3) sentence 1 AktG, the Supervisory Board shall \\npropose Supervisory Board members to the Annual General Meeting for election. These proposals require a \\nmajority of the votes of the shareholder representative members of the Supervisory Board. The next scheduled \\nelection to the Supervisory Board will take place at the 2024 Annual General Meeting. The Annual General \\nMeeting is not required to follow the election proposals. Accordingly, the appointment objectives and \\ncompetency requirements set out by the Supervisory Board below do not constitute requirements to be met by \\nthose eligible to elect or delegate members. Instead, they are intended to express the objectives pursued by \\nthe Supervisory Board in office with regard to its advisory and monitoring functions. \\n\\nFor the Supervisory Board of Merck KGaA, professional qualifications and personal expertise are the two most \\nimportant prerequisites for appointments to positions on the Supervisory Board. In accordance with the German \\nStock Corporation Act, at least one member of the Supervisory Board must have knowledge and expertise in \\nthe area of accounting, and at least one additional member of the Supervisory Board must have knowledge and \\nexpertise in the auditing of financial statements. The expertise in the field of accounting shall consist of special \\nknowledge and experience in the application of accounting principles and internal control and risk management \\nsystems, and the expertise in the field of auditing shall consist of special knowledge and experience in the \\nauditing of financial statements. Accounting and auditing also include sustainability reporting and its audit and \\nassurance. The Chair of the Audit Committee shall have appropriate expertise in at least one of the two areas \\nand shall be independent. When proposing Supervisory Board candidates for election or delegation, the \\nSupervisory Board will always give top priority to these prerequisites, which are essential for fulfilling its legal \\nduties. Overall, the Supervisory Board’s policy is to optimally meet its monitoring and advisory duties by \\nensuring diversity among its members. In particular, diversity includes internationality as well as different \\n\\n \\n\\x0cCorporate Governance ___ Objectives of the Supervisory Board with respect to its Composition and Profile of Skills and Expertise \\n\\n224  \\n\\nexperience backgrounds and career paths. The proportion of women on the Supervisory Board is also \\nconsidered to be an aspect of diversity. When preparing proposals for election or delegation to the Supervisory \\nBoard, the Supervisory Board shall consider in each case to what extent different, complementary specialist \\nskills, professional and life experience, and an appropriate representation of both genders benefit the work of \\nthe Supervisory Board. Additionally, the Supervisory Board shall support the Executive Board in its efforts to \\nincrease diversity within the company. \\n\\nObjectives of the Supervisory Board with respect to its composition \\n\\nAccording to recommendation C.1 of the German Corporate Governance Code in the version dated \\nApril 28, 2022, the Supervisory Board has specified the following objectives regarding its composition, and \\nreports below on their status of implementation. \\n\\nInternationality \\n\\nThe Supervisory Board shall have at least three members with business experience in the main sales markets of \\nMerck KGaA. Currently, the main sales markets of Merck KGaA are Europe, America, and Asia-Pacific. The \\npresent composition of the Supervisory Board satisfies this objective. More than three Supervisory Board \\nmembers have entrepreneurial experience in a wide range of European countries. More than three Supervisory \\nBoard members have experience in management positions in companies that operate globally. \\n\\nWomen on the Supervisory Board \\n\\nSix women are currently members of the Supervisory Board of Merck KGaA. This corresponds to a share of \\nwomen of 37.5%. When nominating candidates for election to the Supervisory Board or making proposals for \\ndelegations, the Supervisory Board shall examine whether the percentage of women can be increased by \\nsuitable candidates. The Supervisory Board considers the 37.5% share of female members to be satisfactory at \\nthe present time. This is due to the percentage of women in leadership positions at Merck and in consideration \\nof the composition of the Supervisory Boards of other companies of comparable size. \\n\\nIndependence \\n\\nThe Supervisory Board shall have an appropriate number of independent shareholder representatives as \\nmembers. In any case, at least five of the shareholder representatives on the Supervisory Board shall be \\nindependent. According to the Articles of Association of Merck KGaA, six members representing the \\nshareholders are to be elected by the Annual General Meeting, and two members are to be delegated. Taking \\nthis and the special ownership structure of Merck KGaA into account, the shareholder representatives consider \\nfive shareholder representatives to be an appropriate number of independent members. In the opinion of the \\nshareholder representatives, the objectives concerning independent members are met at the present time. The \\nshareholder representatives consider the following members to be independent: Wolfgang Büchele, Michael \\nKleinemeier, Renate Koehler, Peter Emanuel Merck, Helene von Roeder, Helga Rübsamen-Schaeff, Daniel \\nThelen, and Simon Thelen. In particular, the shareholder representatives do not believe that membership of the \\nBoard of Partners of E. Merck KG conflicts with independence. The Board of Partners exists to complement the \\nskills and expertise of the Supervisory Board and its activities. This is not expected to lead to material and not \\nmerely temporary conflicts of interest. It should also be taken into account that, due to its substantial capital \\ninvestment and unlimited personal liability, E. Merck KG has a strong interest in the businesses of Merck KGaA \\noperating efficiently and in compliance with procedures, thus counteracting from the outset any conflicts of \\ninterest between E. Merck KG and Merck KGaA and hence any corresponding conflicts of interest between the \\nmembers of the respective corporate boards. \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cCorporate Governance ___ Objectives of the Supervisory Board with respect to its Composition and Profile of Skills and Expertise \\n\\n225  \\n\\nNo material conflicts of interest \\n\\nMoreover, no one shall be proposed for election to the Supervisory Board who simultaneously serves on a board \\nof or advises a major competitor of the company, or who, owing to another function, such as advisor to major \\ncontractual partners of the company, could potentially become involved in a conflict of interest. No Supervisory \\nBoard member serves on a board of or advises a major competitor. Moreover, no Supervisory Board member \\nperforms a function that could lead to a lasting conflict of interest. \\n\\nAge limit \\n\\nAs a rule, the members of the Supervisory Board shall not exceed the age of 75. This objective is met at the \\npresent time. \\n\\nRegular limit on the length of Supervisory Board membership \\n\\nThe objective of the Supervisory Board regarding its composition is that, as a rule, all members shall belong to \\nthe board for an uninterrupted period of no more than 12 years. This objective is also met at the present time. \\nThe length of membership of the Supervisory Board members is set out in the “Procedures of the Executive \\nBoard, Supervisory Board, Board of Partners, and its Committees” section of the Statement on Corporate \\nGovernance. \\n\\nProfile of skills and expertise \\n\\nAdditionally, in accordance with recommendation C.1 of the German Corporate Governance Code in the version \\ndated April 28, 2022, the Supervisory Board has prepared a profile of skills and expertise and reports on the \\nstatus of implementation below. \\n\\nSector \\nKnowledge (HC \\n\\nManagement \\n\\nAccounting \\nincl. \\nSustainability \\n\\nand LS/EL)   \\n\\nExperience   \\n\\nReporting1,2   \\n\\nAuditing²   \\n\\nExternal \\nSupervisory or \\nControl \\nBodies³    Sustainability   \\n\\nBusiness \\nAdministration \\n\\nWolfgang Büchele (Chair) \\n\\nSascha Held (Vice Chair) \\n\\nBirgit Biermann \\n\\nGabriele Eismann \\n\\nJürgen Glaser \\n\\nMichael Kleinemeier \\n\\nRenate Koehler \\n\\nAnne Lange \\n\\nPeter Emanuel Merck \\n\\nDietmar Oeter \\n\\nAlexander Putz \\n\\nChristian Raabe \\n\\nHelene von Roeder \\n\\nHelga Rübsamen-Schaeff \\n\\nDaniel Thelen \\n\\nSimon Thelen \\n\\n● \\n\\n● \\n\\n- \\n\\n● \\n\\n● \\n\\n● \\n\\n● \\n\\n● \\n\\n● \\n\\n● \\n\\n● \\n\\n- \\n\\n● \\n\\n● \\n\\n● \\n\\n● \\n\\n● \\n\\n● \\n\\n● \\n\\n● \\n\\n● \\n\\n● \\n\\n● \\n\\n● \\n\\n● \\n\\n● \\n\\n● \\n\\n● \\n\\n● \\n\\n● \\n\\n● \\n\\n● \\n\\n- \\n\\n- \\n\\n- \\n\\n- \\n\\n- \\n\\n- \\n\\n- \\n\\n- \\n\\n● \\n\\n- \\n\\n● \\n\\n● \\n\\n● \\n\\n● \\n\\n- \\n\\n● \\n\\n- \\n\\n- \\n\\n- \\n\\n- \\n\\n- \\n\\n- \\n\\n- \\n\\n- \\n\\n- \\n\\n- \\n\\n- \\n\\n● \\n\\n- \\n\\n- \\n\\n- \\n\\n● \\n\\n- \\n\\n● \\n\\n- \\n\\n● \\n\\n● \\n\\n- \\n\\n- \\n\\n● \\n\\n- \\n\\n- \\n\\n- \\n\\n● \\n\\n● \\n\\n● \\n\\n- \\n\\n● \\n\\n● \\n\\n● \\n\\n● \\n\\n- \\n\\n● \\n\\n- \\n\\n● \\n\\n● \\n\\n● \\n\\n● \\n\\n● \\n\\n- \\n\\n● \\n\\n- \\n\\n- \\n\\n● \\n\\n● \\n\\n- \\n\\n● \\n\\n● \\n\\n● \\n\\n- \\n\\n● \\n\\n● \\n\\n● \\n\\n● \\n\\n● \\n\\n● \\n\\n● \\n\\n● \\n\\n● \\n\\n1 Including internal control system & risk management system. \\n\\n2 According to the German Corporate Governance Code, experience in the fields of accounting and auditing requires own activity  in these areas. \\n\\n3 Not Supervisory Board or Board of Partners at Merck. \\n\\n● Criterion met, based on a self-assessment by the Supervisory Board.

The directive has yet to be translated into local \\nlaw in the countries in which Merck is active. Merck is continuously analyzing the latest legislative developments \\nand their impact on the countries affected. As the details of the implementation have yet to be finalized, it is \\nnot possible to reliably quantify the financial impact at present.  \\n\\n Accounting and measurement policies  \\n\\nCurrency translation \\n\\nFunctional currency \\n\\nTo a predominant extent, the subsidiaries of Merck KGaA conduct their business independently so that the \\nfunctional currency is normally the respective local currency. \\n\\nHowever, some subsidiaries, particularly in the Electronics business sector, use the U.S. dollar as their \\nfunctional currency rather than the local currency. \\n\\nTransactions in non-functional currency \\n\\nWhen the financial statements of consolidated companies are prepared, business transactions that are \\nconducted in currencies other than the functional currency are translated using the exchange rate on the date \\nof the transaction. \\n\\nTranslation of financial statements into the reporting currency (euro) \\n\\nThe financial statements of consolidated companies not using the euro as their functional currency are \\ntranslated into the reporting currency, the euro. Assets and liabilities are measured at the closing rate while \\nincome and expenses are translated at average monthly rates. Any currency translation differences arising \\nduring consolidation of Group companies are recognized in equity. \\n\\nHyperinflation \\n\\nArgentina (since 2018) and Turkey (since April 2022) are classified as hyperinflationary economies in \\naccordance with IAS 29 “Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies”. Accordingly, business activities in \\nArgentina are no longer reported at historical cost but are presented adjusted for inflation. In Argentina, Merck \\nuses a combination of the wholesale index IPIM (Índice de precios internos al por mayor) and the consumer \\nprice index IPC (Índice de precios al consumidor). The index applied stood at 14,227.3 as of the balance sheet \\ndate (December 31, 2021: 7,396.8/January 1, 2021: 4,896.2). In Turkey, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) \\npublished by the Turkish Statistical Institute is applied retrospectively with effect from January 1, 2022. The \\nindex applied stood at 1,128.5 as of the balance sheet date (December 31, 2021: 687.0). In accordance with \\nthe requirements of IAS 21 “The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates” for financial statements in non-\\nhyperinflationary reporting currencies, the prior-year amounts have not been restated. \\n\\nThe respective loss on the net monetary position is reported under remaining other operating expenses in other \\noperating expenses; see Note (14) “Other operating expenses”. \\n\\nAfter adjusting the amounts for inflation, the balance sheet items and income and expenses are translated into \\nthe reporting currency, the euro, at the closing rate in accordance with IAS 21.42. Prior-year comparative \\nfigures are not restated. \\n\\n \\n \\n\\x0cConsolidated Financial Statements ___ Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements ___ General Disclosures \\n\\n236 \\n\\nExchange rates of most significant currencies \\n\\nThe exchange rates of the most significant currencies in these consolidated financial statements were as \\nfollows: \\n\\n€ 1 = \\n\\nChinese renminbi (CNY) \\n\\nJapanese yen (JPY) \\n\\nSwiss franc (CHF) \\n\\nSouth Korean won (KRW) \\n\\nTaiwan dollar (TWD) \\n\\nU.S. dollar (USD) \\n\\nAverage rate \\n\\nClosing rate \\n\\n2022   \\n\\n7.088   \\n\\n2021    Dec. 31, 2022   \\n\\nDec. 31, 2021 \\n\\n7.634   \\n\\n7.420   \\n\\n7.206 \\n\\n137.989   \\n\\n129.848   \\n\\n140.716   \\n\\n130.189 \\n\\n1.005   \\n\\n1.081   \\n\\n0.985   \\n\\n1.034 \\n\\n1,357.642   \\n\\n1,353.475   \\n\\n1,342.189   \\n\\n1,345.493 \\n\\n31.336   \\n\\n33.062   \\n\\n32.728   \\n\\n1.054   \\n\\n1.183   \\n\\n1.065   \\n\\n31.285 \\n\\n1.131 \\n\\n(3)  Discretionary decisions and sources of estimation uncertainty \\n\\nDealing with discretionary decisions and sources of estimation uncertainty \\n\\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires Merck to make discretionary decisions on the \\napplicable accounting and measurement policies as well as estimates to a certain extent. The discretionary \\nscope and estimation uncertainty are assessed in a Merck-specific manner. Discretion describes the need to \\nmake assumptions concerning recognition or measurement when applying accounting policies. Sources of \\nestimation uncertainty relate to the selection of the valuation techniques to be applied and the input factors \\nused therein. The degree of estimation uncertainty may vary considerably depending on the availability and \\nreliability of the input factors. \\n\\nIncreased uncertainty due to the macroeconomic situation  \\n\\nThe dynamic development of the macroeconomic environment means that the degree of uncertainty in the \\npreparation of the consolidated financial statements is considerably higher than was typically the case in the \\npast. In particular, uncertainties include the development of inflation, the development of interest rates, \\ngeopolitical challenges, trade restrictions and sanctions. This applies in particular to the recoverability of non-\\nfinancial assets. Based on the information currently available, there is no evidence of significant impairment \\nlosses to date. Furthermore, as in previous years, there are no grounds to suggest that the going concern \\nassumption should not have been applied in preparing the consolidated financial statements.  \\n\\nImpact of inflation \\n\\nInflation has led to an increase in procurement costs, especially for logistics services, materials and energy (see \\nNote (10) “Cost of sales” and (11) “Marketing and selling expenses”). As in the previous year, the cost of \\npurchasing natural gas and electricity came to a low triple-digit million euro amount for the Group in fiscal \\n2022. The higher level of procurement costs resulted in an increase in the carrying amount of raw materials \\nand supplies as well as work in progress reported in inventories. Merck raised its prices in order to offset these \\nincreased procurement costs. It is typically easier to pass on price increases in the Life Science and Electronics \\nbusiness sectors than in the price-regulated environment of the Healthcare business sector. Furthermore, the \\nassumptions concerning the long-term salary and pension trends applied in calculating pension obligations were \\nreviewed and adjusted to reflect the development of inflation. This resulted in an increase in the defined benefit \\nobligation in connection with the measurement of defined benefit pension plans (see Note (33) “Provisions for \\nemployee benefits”).  \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n \\n \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cConsolidated Financial Statements ___ Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements ___ General Disclosures \\n\\n237 \\n\\nImpact of higher interest rates \\n\\nThe increase in interest rates had an impact on the measurement of provisions for defined benefit pension plans \\n(see Note (33) “Provisions for employee benefits”) and other non-current provisions (see Note (27) “Other \\nprovisions”) in particular, leading to substantial reductions in the amount of the respective obligations.  \\n\\nThe higher interest rates also resulted in a rise in the discount rates applied in performing impairment testing \\nand determining the fair values of financial and non-financial assets (see Note (18) “Goodwill” and Note \\n(43) “Information on fair value measurement” in particular).  \\n\\nDirect impact of the war in Ukraine \\n\\nTo date, the war in Ukraine has not had any material effects on the Merck Group’s net assets, financial position \\nor results of operations owing to its limited business volume in Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and the Republic of \\nMoldova. In fiscal 2022 and 2021 alike, the total share of Group net sales generated in the aforementioned \\ncountries amounted to less than 1.5%. These sales were attributable almost exclusively to the Healthcare \\nbusiness sector as well as the Life Science business sector in connection with the provision of medical care. \\nWith the exception of Russia, Merck does not have any subsidiaries of its own in this region. Trade receivables \\nfrom customers in Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and the Republic of Moldova are partly covered by credit insurance. \\nThe payment behavior of customers in the affected region is being monitored very closely. There were no \\nnotable loss allowances as of December 31, 2022. To date, local payments to customers and employees in \\nRussia as well as international payments with Russia have been ensured without restriction. \\n\\nImpact of trade restrictions, sanctions and supply chain bottlenecks \\n\\nSome inventories were increased in order to limit the risks in connection with supply chain disruption. \\nAccordingly, there is a heightened risk of subsequent write-downs if it is not possible to process or sell these \\ninventories. Furthermore, the impact of the trade restrictions concerning semiconductors that were imposed \\nbetween the United States of America and China in the fourth quarter of 2022 was examined with a view to the \\nrecoverability of assets that could be affected. No impairment losses have been recognized to date. However, \\nthere is considerable uncertainty with regard to future developments. \\n\\nIncreased uncertainty due to climate risks \\n\\nAs a globally active science and technology group, Merck is subject to transition-related and physical climate \\nrisks that could have a potentially negative impact on its net assets, financial position, and results of operations \\nand lead to increased estimation uncertainty in its accounting.  \\n\\nPhysical climate risks describe the risks that could result from longer-term changes in the general climatic \\nconditions. To determine the physical climate risk exposure, significant Merck Group locations are subject to a \\nstructured climate risk analysis as part of a project aimed at implementing the recommendations of the “Task \\nForce on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures” (TCFD). This involves simulating the long-term impact of \\nvarious warming scenarios on the locations analyzed. The potential financial consequences of climate-related \\nnatural events, such as flooding, torrential rainfall and hurricanes, are covered by insurance policies to an \\nappropriate extent. Based on the information currently available, physical climate risks are not currently \\nexpected to have any direct accounting impact.   \\n\\nTransition-related climate risks describe the consequences for companies as a result of the transition to a \\nsustainable economic system. Merck has set itself the goal of reducing its direct (Scope 1) and indirect \\n(Scope 2) greenhouse gas emissions by 50% in the period from 2020 to 2030. This will be achieved by lowering \\nprocess-related emissions, implementing energy efficiency measures, and increasingly purchasing electricity \\nfrom renewable sources (see the disclosures in Note (42) “Management of financial risks” on a virtual power \\npurchase agreement with a wind energy project developer in the United States). Merck also plans to reduce the \\nindirect emissions along the entire value chain (Scope 3) in terms of metric kilotons of CO2 equivalents per euro \\nof gross profit by 52% by 2030 and to achieve climate-neutral business operations along the entire value chain \\n\\n \\n \\n\\x0cConsolidated Financial Statements ___ Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements ___ General Disclosures \\n\\n238 \\n\\n(Scope 1-3) by 2040. In April 2022, the Science Based Targets Initiative confirmed that the targets for 2030 \\nand the necessary measures support the ambitions of the Science Based Targets Initiative and the Paris \\nAgreement to limit global warming to 1.5 °C.  \\n\\nThe most significant transition-related climate risks to the net assets, financial position, and results of \\noperations are in the Electronics business sector, which is responsible for well in excess of half of the Group’s \\ndirect (Scope 1) and indirect (Scope 2) greenhouse gas emissions. The majority of the greenhouse gas \\nemissions in this business sector take the form of process-related emissions resulting from the production of \\nspecialty gases for the semiconductor and electronics industries. In order to achieve the climate goals it has \\nadopted, the Group intends to reduce the emissions in its business with these specialty gases by making \\ntechnological improvements to the production process in particular. Based on the information currently \\navailable, the implementation of Merck’s sustainability strategy is not expected to result in a significant decline \\nin net sales in this business. There have been no indications of impairment of the assets concerned to date, nor \\nhas it been necessary to adjust their remaining useful lives.  \\n\\n \\n \\n\\x0cConsolidated Financial Statements ___ Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements ___ General Disclosures \\n\\n239 \\n\\nOverview of significant discretionary decisions and sources of estimation uncertainty \\n\\nThe accounting matters with the most significant discretionary decisions as well as the most comprehensive \\nassumptions relating to the future and sources of estimation uncertainty are described below: \\n\\nAccounting matter \\n\\nGoodwill \\n\\nDetermination of recoverable amount \\n\\nOther intangible assets \\n\\nIdentification and measurement of intangible assets within the \\nscope of business combinations \\n\\nIn-licensing of intangible assets \\n\\nDetermination of amortization \\n\\nIdentification of impairments or reversal of impairments \\n\\nProperty, plant, and equipment \\n\\nDetermination of depreciation \\n\\nIdentification of impairments or reversal of impairments \\n\\nLeases \\n\\nRecognition and measurement of lease arrangements \\n\\nInventories \\n\\nIdentification of impairments or reversal of impairments \\n\\nTrade and other receivables \\n\\nDetermination of loss allowance \\n\\nOther financial assets \\n\\nCarrying \\namount as \\nof Dec. \\n31, 2022 in \\n\\n€ million   \\n\\n18,415   \\n\\nDiscretionary \\nscope/ \\nestimation \\nuncertainty   \\n\\nIFRS   \\n\\nIAS 36   \\n\\nhigh   \\n\\nSensitivity \\n\\nanalysis   \\n\\nyes   \\n\\nNote \\n\\n18 \\n\\n7,302   \\n\\nyes   \\n\\n6, 19 \\n\\nIFRS 3 \\n\\nhigh \\n\\nIAS 38    medium   \\n\\nIAS 38    medium   \\n\\nIAS 36   \\n\\nhigh   \\n\\nIAS 16    medium   \\n\\nIAS 36    medium   \\n\\nIFRS 16    medium   \\n\\nIAS 2    medium   \\n\\nIFRS 9    medium   \\n\\n8,203   \\n\\n481   \\n\\n4,632   \\n\\n4,141   \\n\\nno   \\n\\n20 \\n\\nyes   \\n\\nno   \\n\\n21 \\n\\n24 \\n\\nno   \\n\\n25, 42 \\n\\nyes   \\n\\n36, 43 \\n\\nDetermination of fair values of contingent considerations \\n\\n250   \\n\\nIFRS 13   \\n\\nhigh   \\n\\nDetermination of fair values of equity instruments \\n\\n516 \\n\\nIFRS 9, \\nIFRS 13   \\n\\nmedium \\n\\nProvisions for employee benefits \\n\\nyes   \\n\\n33 \\n\\nDetermination of present value of defined-benefit obligations \\n\\n4,287   \\n\\nIAS 19    medium   \\n\\nDetermination of parameters for the valuation of fair values of \\nshare-based payment programs \\n\\n254 \\n\\nIFRS 2 \\n\\nmedium \\n\\nOther provisions and contingent liabilities \\n\\n672   \\n\\nno   \\n\\n27, 28 \\n\\nRecognition and measurement of other provisions and \\ncontingent liabilities \\n\\nRevenue recognition \\n\\nIAS 37 \\n\\nhigh \\n\\nMeasurement of sales deductions and refund liabilities \\n\\n912   \\n\\nIFRS 15   \\n\\nhigh   \\n\\nIncome tax \\n\\nRecognition and measurement of income tax liabilities \\n\\n1,522   \\n\\nIAS 12   \\n\\nhigh   \\n\\nRecognition and measurement of deferred taxes from temporary \\ndifferences \\n\\nIAS 12 \\n\\nmedium \\n\\nRecognition of deferred tax assets from tax loss carryforwards \\n\\n30   \\n\\nIAS 12   \\n\\nhigh   \\n\\nyes   \\n\\n9 \\n\\nno   \\n\\n15 \\n\\n(4)  Subsequent events \\n\\nMerck is currently coordinating with the employee representatives a program to continuously improve processes \\nand align the Group functions more closely with the businesses.

The two companies accounted for using the \\nequity method are Syntropy Technologies LLC, United States, and MM Domain Holdco Limited, United Kingdom. \\nIn addition, there are two joint operations (Hydrochlor, LLC, United States, and Showa Denko Versum Materials \\n2 Co., Ltd., Japan) within the meaning of IFRS 11.

As observable market prices \\nare mostly not available for the acquired other intangible assets, Merck regularly relies on the expertise of \\nexternal professionals when it comes to business combinations. The following overview shows the methods \\ntypically used to measure intangible assets within the scope of purchase price allocations: \\n\\nCustomer relationships \\n\\nTechnology \\n\\nTrademark \\n\\nMeasurement method for determining fair value \\n\\nMulti-period excess earnings method \\n\\nRelief from royalty method \\n\\nRelief from royalty method \\n\\nResults from foreign currency hedging of expected business combinations, if they meet the requirements for \\nhedge accounting, are offset against the carrying value of the net assets acquired. \\n\\nWhere management considers it to be appropriate, the optional concentration test set out in IFRS 3.B7B is \\napplied in individual transactions in order to determine the presentation of the transaction in the consolidated \\n\\nfinancial statements. \\n\\n Significant discretionary decisions and sources of estimation uncertainty  \\n\\nBusiness combinations \\n\\nIn particular, estimation uncertainty and discretionary decisions in conjunction with purchase price allocation \\nrelate to  \\n\\n•  planning of future cash flows,  \\n\\n• \\n\\nthe customer churn rate, which indicates how existing customer relationships will change in the future,  \\n\\n• \\n\\nthe license rate for technologies, which estimates royalty savings on the basis of comparable transactions of \\nsimilar technologies,  \\n\\n• \\n\\nthe discount factor, which is applied for maturity- and risk-based discounting of expected cash inflows, and \\n\\n• \\n\\nthe useful life and the degree of technical obsolescence which depend, among other things, on assumptions \\nabout technological developments.  \\n\\nDivestments \\n\\nThe assessment as to when a non-current asset, disposal group, or discontinued operation meets the \\nprerequisites of IFRS 5 for classification as “held for sale” is subject to discretionary judgment. Even in the case \\nof an existing management decision to review a disposal, an uncertain assessment has to be made as to the \\n\\nprobability of whether a corresponding disposal will occur during the year. \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cConsolidated Financial Statements ___ Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements ___ Group Structure \\n\\n242 \\n\\nAcquisitions \\n\\nAcquisition of Exelead Inc., United States \\n\\nOn December 30, 2021, Merck signed a definitive agreement to acquire Exelead Inc., United States (Exelead), a \\nbiopharmaceutical contract development and manufacturing organization (CDMO). The transaction closed on \\nFebruary 22, 2022, after regulatory clearances and the satisfaction of other customary closing conditions. The \\npurchase price amounted to US$ 793 million (€ 702 million) in cash. In the consolidated cash flow statement, \\n€ 694 million has been disclosed as net cash outflows from acquisitions less acquired cash and cash equivalents.  \\n\\nExelead specializes in complex injectable formulations, including the lipid nanoparticles that are key \\ncomponents of mRNA (messenger ribonucleic acid) therapeutics for treating Covid-19 and other indications. The \\naim of the acquisition is to use Exelead’s capacities and expertise to expand the service range for mRNA \\ncontract development and manufacturing and to provide a fully integrated offering across the entire mRNA \\nmanufacturing process. The business is being integrated into the Life Science Services business unit, which is \\npart of the Life Science business sector. \\n\\nMaterial contingent liabilities were not identified as part of the purchase price allocation.  \\n\\nThe positive difference between the purchase price and the net assets acquired of € 462 million was recognized \\nas goodwill. This includes expected earnings synergies resulting from the integration of Exelead into the Merck \\nGroup, expected revenues from technical innovations and developments that go beyond the current product, \\ndevelopment, and customer portfolios, and unrecognized intangible assets such as the expertise of the \\nworkforce. The goodwill was allocated in full to the Life Science business sector. As expected, the goodwill is \\nnon-tax deductible. As a result of foreign exchange developments, goodwill carried in U.S. dollars increased \\nfrom € 462 million on first-time recognition to € 490 million as of December 31, 2022.  \\n\\nFor the period between the acquisition and December 31, 2022, the legacy Exelead business contributed \\n€ 75 million to Group net sales as well as € -37 million to net income after taxes. This result also includes \\nhigher cost of sales due to the step-up of the acquired inventories to fair values as well as the amortization of \\nassets identified and remeasured during purchase price allocation.  \\n\\nAssuming the first-time consolidation of Exelead as of January 1, 2022, sales of the Merck Group for the period \\nwould have been € 22,241 million (compared with reported net sales of € 22,232 million), and net income after \\ntaxes would have been € 3,337 million (compared with reported net income after taxes of € 3,339 million). \\nWhen calculating these figures, it was assumed that the adjustments to carrying amounts resulting from \\npurchase price allocation had been identical and would have been taken into account in accordance with their \\nuseful life in terms of their effects on the consolidated income statement. \\n\\nAcquisition of the chemicals business of Mecaro Co. Ltd., Korea \\n\\nOn December 30, 2022, Merck successfully completed the acquisition of the chemicals business of Mecaro Co. \\nLtd., Korea (Mecaro), trading as M Chemicals Inc., Korea (M Chemicals), after obtaining the necessary \\nregulatory clearances; the acquisition had been announced on August 17, 2022. Mecaro is a Korea-based, \\npublicly listed manufacturer of heater blocks and chemical precursors for semiconductors.  \\n\\nThe acquisition forms part of the Level Up growth program of the Electronics business sector. M Chemicals has \\naround 100 employees and primarily develops and produces precursors used in thin film deposition. The total \\npurchase price involves payments totaling € 90 million, of which € 80 million were due and had been paid as of \\nthe reporting date. In the consolidated cash flow statement, € 77 million was recognized in net cash outflows \\nfrom acquisitions less acquired cash and cash equivalents. The contractually agreed contingent milestone \\npayments have not led to an increase of the transaction price.  \\n\\nNo preliminary purchase price allocation had taken place by the time the Consolidated Financial Statements were \\nprepared. The total difference between the purchase price and the net assets acquired, amounting to € 46 million, \\n\\n \\n \\n\\x0cConsolidated Financial Statements ___ Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements ___ Group Structure \\n\\n243 \\n\\nwas therefore recognized as goodwill on a preliminary basis. The goodwill was allocated in full to the Electronics \\nbusiness sector. As expected, it is non-tax deductible. The goodwill was recognized in South Korean won.  \\n\\nAcquisition of Erbi Biosystems Inc., United States \\n\\nMerck acquired all the shares in Erbi Biosystems Inc., United States (Erbi), on December 1, 2022. The purchase \\nprice amounted to € 78 million in cash. In the consolidated cash flow statement, € 73 million was recognized in \\nnet cash outflows from acquisitions less acquired cash and cash equivalents and other adjustments.  \\n\\nErbi is the developer of BreezTM, one of the few micro-scale, fully automated, functionally closed and continuous \\nperfusion cell culture platform technologies on the market. By integrating BreezTM into its existing Mobius® \\nportfolio, Merck can offer a full range of bioreactors, cell retention systems and devices as well as cell culture \\nmedia. The business is allocated to the Process Solutions business unit in the Life Science business sector. \\n\\nNo preliminary purchase price allocation had taken place by the time the Consolidated Financial Statements \\nwere prepared. The total difference between the purchase price and the net assets acquired was therefore \\nrecognized as goodwill. The goodwill was recognized in full in the Life Science business sector. As expected, it is \\nnon-tax deductible. As a result of foreign exchange developments, goodwill carried in U.S. dollars decreased \\nfrom € 74 million on first-time recognition to € 72 million as of December 31, 2022. \\n\\nFair value of the acquisitions \\n\\nThe determination of the fair values for Exelead was performed by an external valuation expert and completed \\nby December 31, 2022. In the case of the Erbi and M Chemicals acquisitions, the carrying amounts as of the \\nacquisition date have been recognized as preliminary fair values because the completion date was shortly \\nbefore the reporting date. The fair values for the acquisitions were as follows: \\n\\n€ million \\n\\nNon-current assets \\n\\nIntangible assets (excluding goodwill) \\n\\nProperty, plant and equipment \\n\\nOther non-current assets \\n\\nCurrent assets \\n\\nInventories \\n\\nTrade and other current receivables \\n\\nCash and cash equivalents \\n\\nOther current assets \\n\\nTotal assets \\n\\nNon-current liabilities \\n\\nOther non-current provisions and liabilities \\n\\nDeferred tax liabilities \\n\\nCurrent liabilities \\n\\nTrade payables and other liabilities \\n\\nOther current liabilities and provisions \\n\\nTotal liabilities \\n\\nNet assets acquired \\n\\nPurchase price for the acquisition of shares in accordance with IFRS 3 \\n\\nPositive difference (goodwill) \\n\\n1 Preliminary fair values. \\n\\n  Fair value at the acquisition date \\n\\nExelead \\n\\nOther \\naquisitions1 \\n\\n160   \\n\\n49   \\n\\n3   \\n\\n213   \\n\\n47   \\n\\n12   \\n\\n8   \\n\\n27   \\n\\n94   \\n\\n307   \\n\\n4   \\n\\n41   \\n\\n45   \\n\\n13   \\n\\n9   \\n\\n22   \\n\\n67   \\n\\n240   \\n\\n702   \\n\\n462   \\n\\n1 \\n\\n31 \\n\\n– \\n\\n32 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n– \\n\\n18 \\n\\n50 \\n\\n1 \\n\\n– \\n\\n1 \\n\\n– \\n\\n2 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n47 \\n\\n167 \\n\\n120 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n    \\n\\x0cConsolidated Financial Statements ___ Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements ___ Group Structure \\n\\n244 \\n\\n(7)  Collaboration and licensing agreements \\n\\n Accounting and measurement policies  \\n\\nOut-licensing agreements \\n\\nMerck primarily enters into material out-licensing agreements for intellectual property in the Healthcare \\nbusiness sector. In the vast majority of cases, the granting of a license constitutes a distinct performance \\nobligation that must usually be recognized at a point in time. Due to the uncertainty of development results and \\nregulatory events, contingent consideration is typically recognized when the event in question has occurred. \\nSales-based and usage-based royalties are recognized when the contract partner makes the corresponding \\nsales or uses the intellectual property. As out-licensing transactions in the Healthcare business sector do not \\nform part of ordinary activities and the licensees do not constitute customers within the meaning of \\nIFRS 15, the corresponding income from upfront payments, milestone payments, and royalties is reported in \\nother operating income (see Note (13) “Other operating income”). \\n\\nIn-licensing agreements \\n\\nThe accounting and measurement policies for the in-licensing of intellectual property are presented in Note \\n(19) “Other intangible assets”. \\n\\nCollaboration agreements \\n\\nIn addition to out-licensing agreements for selling intellectual property, Merck enters into collaboration \\nagreements in the Healthcare business sector in which the Group works with partners to develop \\npharmaceutical drug candidates and, if regulatory approval is granted, to commercialize them. The agreements \\nwith Pfizer Inc., United States (Pfizer), in the field of immuno-oncology represent the most significant \\ncollaboration. The immuno-oncology collaboration with GlaxoSmithKline plc, United Kingdom, on the drug \\ncandidate bintrafusp alfa was ended amicably, effective September 30, 2021.  \\n\\nAs the partner companies do not have customer characteristics, these collaboration agreements do not fall \\ndirectly within the scope of IFRS 15, and any income from upfront payments, milestone payments, and \\nroyalties is reported under other operating income. Reimbursements of research and development costs made \\nbetween the collaboration partners are recognized on a net basis in research and development costs. Merck \\nrecognizes the consideration received in the course of collaboration agreements for bundled obligations arising \\nfrom granting rights to intellectual property as well as other goods and services promised as income over the \\nperformance period in line with industry practice. Income is caught up cumulatively upon receipt of uncertain \\nfuture milestone payments attributable to contractual obligations which have already been fulfilled. This refers \\nespecially to milestone payments subsequent to regulatory approval. Furthermore, collaboration agreements in \\nthe Healthcare business sector typically allocate the net sales generated in specific markets, or with specific \\nproducts, to the respective collaboration partners in the event of a successful approval; in turn, defined income \\nand expense items are carried by the collaboration partners according to fixed allocation ratios. Under these \\ncircumstances, Merck recognizes the net sales from the commercialization of products to third-party customers, \\nif Merck takes on the role of a principal within the meaning of IFRS 15. Expenses resulting from payments made \\nto collaboration partners in connection with profit share agreements are reported under “Other operating \\n\\nexpenses”. \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cConsolidated Financial Statements ___ Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements ___ Group Structure \\n\\n245 \\n\\n Significant discretionary decisions and sources of estimation uncertainty   \\n\\nCollaboration and licensing agreements \\n\\nAs part of the accounting treatment of collaboration and licensing agreements, significant discretionary \\ndecisions have to be made in the following areas: \\n\\n• \\n\\nIdentification of an appropriate income recognition method; \\n\\n•  Determination of the appropriate timing of income recognition. \\n\\nEstimates are to be made especially when it comes to determining the transaction price and progress on the \\nperformance obligation. \\n\\nStrategic alliance with Pfizer Inc., United States, to jointly co-develop and co-\\ncommercialize active ingredients in immuno-oncology \\n\\nOn November 17, 2014, Merck formed a global strategic alliance with Pfizer to co-develop and co-commercialize \\nthe anti-PD-L1 antibody avelumab. Avelumab received its first regulatory approvals in 2017 under the trade \\nname Bavencio®. The overriding objective of the strategic alliance is to share the development risks and to \\nexpand the two companies’ presence in immuno-oncology. The execution of the collaboration agreement is not \\nbeing structured through a separate vehicle. Upon entry into the agreement in 2014, Pfizer made an upfront \\ncash payment of US$ 850 million (€ 678 million) to Merck, which was recognized in the income statement until \\nthe end of 2019. Pfizer also committed to making further payments of up to US$ 2 billion to Merck subject to \\nthe achievement of defined development and commercial milestones. \\n\\nAccording to the collaboration agreement, during the development period each company bears one half of the \\ndevelopment expenses. In the commercialization phase, Merck recognizes the majority of net sales from the \\ncommercialization of Bavencio® while Merck and Pfizer evenly split the net amount of sales less defined \\nexpense components. Net sales generated with Bavencio® amounted to € 611 million in the year under review \\n(2021: € 373 million). Merck recognized a high double-digit million euro amount in research and development \\nexpenses in fiscal 2022, as in the previous year, as well as profit transfer expenses of € 255 million (2021: \\n€ 159 million). Merck also realized other operating income of € 50 million in the previous year. This resulted \\nfrom the achievement of two approval milestones. \\n\\nEnd of strategic alliance with GlaxoSmithKline plc, United Kingdom, to co-develop and co-\\ncommercialize active ingredients in immuno-oncology \\n\\nOn February 5, 2019, Merck had entered into a global agreement in the field of immuno-oncology with a \\nsubsidiary of GSK to co-develop and co-commercialize the drug candidate bintrafusp alfa (formerly M7824).  \\n\\nIn the third quarter of 2021, it was amicably decided with GSK that the agreement on bintrafusp alfa would end \\neffective September 30, 2021. The decision was based on the clinical study data gathered by that time, and in \\nparticular the results of the INTR@PID Lung 037 study on the first-line treatment of patients with non-small cell \\nlung cancer, which failed to reproduce the promising results of previous studies.  \\n\\nMerck recognized research and development costs in a low triple-digit million euro amount in the previous year. \\nThis included a mid double-digit million euro amount in expenses for the recognition of provisions for follow-on \\nobligations, which were recognized as a result of the termination of the collaboration in the third quarter of 2021. \\nFurthermore, other operating income of € 123 million was recognized in the previous year from the reversal in \\nprofit or loss of the remainder of an upfront payment that was received from GSK and deferred in 2019. \\n\\n \\n \\n\\x0cConsolidated Financial Statements ___ Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements ___ Group Structure \\n\\n246 \\n\\nIn-licensing agreement with Debiopharm International SA, Switzerland, on drug \\ncandidates for the treatment of head and neck cancer \\n\\nOn March 1, 2021, Merck announced its entry into an in-licensing agreement with Debiopharm International SA, \\nSwitzerland (Debiopharm), for the exclusive rights for the development and global commercialization of the \\ndrug candidate xevinapant (Debio 1143), and for the development of preclinical follow-on compounds. \\nXevinapant is currently being investigated in a phase III study for patients with untreated high-risk locally \\nadvanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy \\nand standard fractionation intensity-modulated radiotherapy.  \\n\\nMerck made upfront payments of € 188 million in conjunction with the agreement. Moreover, Debiopharm \\nreceived a right to future milestone payments of up to € 710 million in total, dependent on the achievement of \\ncertain development and sales milestones, plus royalties on future net sales. The transaction became effective \\nin April 2021. The upfront cash payment resulted in the recognition of an intangible asset not yet available for \\nuse in the amount of € 118 million, an asset under other financial assets for claims for reimbursement in \\nrespect of Debiopharm, and a prepayment for future development activities. \\n\\nOut-licensing agreement with MoonLake Immunotherapeutics AG, Switzerland, on a drug \\ncandidate for the treatment of several inflammatory diseases \\n\\nOn May 3, 2021, Merck announced the conclusion of an out-licensing agreement on sonelokimab (M1095) with \\nMoonLake Immunotherapeutics AG, Switzerland (MoonLake). Sonelokimab is an investigational anti-IL-17 A/F \\nNanobody® that neutralizes both IL-17A and IL-17F in patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque-type \\npsoriasis. MoonLake will assume full responsibility for the research, development, and commercialization of \\nsonelokimab. Under the agreement, Merck will receive an upfront cash payment in a low double-digit million \\neuro amount and an equity interest of almost 10% in MoonLake. Depending on the achievement of certain \\ndevelopment and sales milestones, Merck is also entitled to future milestone payments up to a mid triple-digit \\nmillion euro amount, as well as royalties depending on future net sales. The equity instruments received were \\nmeasured at their fair value on initial recognition. The income from the out-licensing of intellectual property in a \\nlow double-digit million euro amount was reported in other operating income in the previous year.\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cConsolidated Financial Statements ___ Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements ___ Operating Activities \\n\\n247 \\n\\nOperating Activities \\n\\n(8)  Segment Reporting \\n\\n Accounting and measurement policies  \\n\\nSegment reporting \\n\\nThe internal organizational and reporting structure of the Merck Group forms the basis of the segmentation of \\nits business activity. It is founded on the business models of the business sectors, leading to largely identical \\nrisk structures within the segments. Resource allocation and the assessment of business development are \\nperformed at the level of the segments by the Executive Board of Merck KGaA as the chief operating decision-\\nmaker. \\n\\nCorporate and Other includes income and expenses, assets, and liabilities, as well as cash flows that cannot be \\nallocated to the reportable segments as they are managed at Group level in central Group functions. Moreover, \\nthe column serves as the reconciliation to the Group figures. As these are managed at the Group level, financial \\nexpenses and financial income, which include interest expenses and interest income, as well as income tax \\nexpenses and income are also disclosed under Corporate and Other.  \\n\\nApart from net sales, the success of a segment is mainly determined by EBITDA pre (segment result). EBITDA \\npre is a key figure that is not defined by International Financial Reporting Standards. However, it represents the \\nmost important variable used to steer the Merck Group.

In line with the product \\nportfolio, customers in this business sector primarily include companies in the pharmaceutical and \\nbiotechnology sectors as well as retailers and public research organizations. The Healthcare business sector \\nincludes business involving prescription pharmaceuticals. Its customers mainly comprise wholesalers, hospitals, \\nand pharmacies. The Electronics business sector bundles all specialty chemical business and almost exclusively \\nserves industrial companies. The fields of activity of the individual segments are described in detail in the \\nsections on the business sectors in the combined management report. \\n\\nNo single customer accounted for more than 10 % of the Group’s total net sales in fiscal 2022 or 2021.

For sales of goods, the \\ncustomer typically obtains control as soon as delivery is made, given that the customer is generally not able to \\nobtain any benefits from the asset before that point in time. In the case of equipment sales, the criteria for \\nrevenue recognition are only met after installation has been successfully completed – to the extent that the \\ninstallation requires specialized knowledge, does not represent a clear ancillary service and the relevant \\nequipment can only be used by the customer once successfully set up. \\n\\nFor service contracts and customer-specific contract manufacturing of goods and equipment, Merck recognizes \\nrevenue over time based on the progress towards complete satisfaction of the performance obligation, if there is \\na contractual claim for payment against the customer for the services already performed and there is no \\nalternative use. Input- and output-oriented methods are used to appropriately determine progress on a contract-\\nspecific basis. Although progress is ideally measured using input-oriented methods, output-oriented methods are \\nalways applied when the input cannot be reliably determined, for example. Specifically, the appropriate degree of \\nprogress is mainly calculated on the basis of milestones reached, time elapsed, units delivered, or costs incurred \\nin proportion to the anticipated total costs.  \\n\\nLicenses for intellectual property are granted to a limited extent in the Life Science and Healthcare business \\nsectors. Unlike in the Life Science business sector, these transactions do not usually form part of ordinary \\nactivities in the Healthcare business sector, meaning that the corresponding income is reported in other operating \\nincome (see Note (7) “Collaboration and licensing agreements” and Note (13) “Other operating income”).  \\n\\nNet sales from contracts comprising several separate performance obligations are recognized on a pro rata basis \\nwhen the respective performance obligation has been fulfilled. Multiple-element arrangements of this nature \\nexist to a limited extent in the Life Science business sector. \\n\\nDetermining the transaction price \\n\\nMerck grants customers various kinds of rebates and discounts. These, as well as anticipated customer refund \\nclaims, state compulsory charges, and rebates from health plans and programs, are deducted from sales. The \\nmost significant portion of these deductions from sales is attributable to the Healthcare business sector and, in \\nparticular, sales in the United States. \\n\\nSales deductions provided on the invoice as price-reducing items, which will likely be applied by customers \\nwhen making the respective payments, are recognized as reduction of trade accounts receivable. Expected \\nrefunds, such as bonus payments, reimbursements for rights of return or rebates from health plans and \\nprograms, are reported in the consolidated balance sheet under refund liabilities. \\n\\nThe measurement of sales deductions and refund liabilities resulting from expected rebates and discounts \\nconsiders the following: \\n\\n•  past experience; \\n\\n•  pricing information; and \\n\\n•  expected sales volume growth rates. \\n\\nThe measurement of sales deductions and refund liabilities resulting from rights of return takes into account \\nhistorical rates of return for individual product groups, information from distributors on inventory levels, and \\npublicly available information on product sales from sector-specific service providers (in the Healthcare business \\nsector). \\n\\n \\n \\n\\x0cConsolidated Financial Statements ___ Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements ___ Operating Activities \\n\\n253 \\n\\nContractual payment terms \\n\\nGiven that the Merck Group generates the large majority of its net sales through transactions with simple \\nstructures, the company usually has an enforceable right to payment after the performance obligation has been \\nfulfilled. The payment targets contractually agreed between Merck Group and its customers usually range \\nbetween 30 and 60 days.  \\n\\nPractical expedients \\n\\nMerck uses the practical expedient of IFRS 15 in which the promised amount of consideration is not adjusted for \\nthe effects of a significant financing component if the period between the fulfillment of a performance obligation \\n\\nand the payment by the customer only amounts to up to one year. \\n\\n Significant discretionary decisions and sources of estimation uncertainty  \\n\\nSales deductions \\n\\nThe measurement of sales deductions and the corresponding refund liabilities requires extensive estimates. \\nUncertainties exist in particular concerning the extent to which past experience serves as a reliable basis for \\nestimating the future development of expected refunds, such as bonus payments, reimbursements for rights of \\nreturn, or rebates from health plans and programs. External information from distributors and industry services \\noutside of Merck’s control, which are also subject to uncertainty, are used to determine sales deductions. \\n\\nDue to a lack of past

The calculation is based on the \\ncompany-specific tax rate applicable in the relevant tax year. \\n\\nUncertain income tax assets and liabilities \\n\\nFactual assessments are made to calculate uncertain income tax assets and liabilities. Uncertain income tax \\nmatters are recognized depending on the likelihood that the responsible tax authorities will accept the \\nrespective income tax treatment. If recognition by the tax authorities is considered unlikely, the respective \\nuncertain tax asset or uncertain tax liability is measured at the most likely amount. Uncertain income tax \\nliabilities are reported within income tax liabilities. Expected income tax-related penalties and interest that do \\nnot fall within the scope of IAS 12 are treated as provisions in line with IAS 37. \\n\\nDeferred taxes \\n\\nDeferred tax assets resulting from deductible temporary differences that exceed deferred tax liabilities relating \\nto the same taxation authority and the same taxable entity are recognized if it is considered probable that \\ntaxable profit will be available against which they can be utilized. This corresponds to the procedure for \\nrecognizing deferred tax assets on unused tax credits and tax loss and interest carryforwards. \\n\\nThe recognition of deferred tax assets requires an estimate of the probability of future use. The influencing \\nfactors considered as part of this assessment include the following: \\n\\n• \\n\\ntemporary differences relating to the same taxation authority and the same taxable entity that will be \\nsubject to taxation in the future, \\n\\n• \\n\\nresults history, \\n\\n• \\n\\nresults planning, and \\n\\n•  existing tax planning of the respective Group company. \\n\\nDeferred tax liabilities for planned dividend payments within the next twelve months of profits already \\n\\ngenerated are recognized. \\n\\n Significant discretionary decisions and sources of estimation uncertainty   \\n\\nIncome taxes \\n\\nThe calculation of the reported assets and liabilities from current and deferred income taxes requires extensive \\ndiscretionary judgments, assumptions and estimates. \\n\\nWhen assessing income tax assets and liabilities, the interpretation of tax provisions may be subject to \\nparticular uncertainty. The possibility that the relevant tax authorities will take a differing view concerning the \\napplication and interpretation of tax standards cannot be ruled out. Changes to the assumptions underlying the \\ninterpretation of tax standards, for example as a result of changes in legislation, are recognized in the balance \\nsheet when the change comes into force. \\n\\nWith regard to deferred tax items, there is uncertainty as to when an asset will be realized or a liability settled. \\nThis applies in particular to deferred taxes recognized in the course of company acquisitions. Assessing the \\nrecoverability, particularly of tax credits and tax loss and interest carryforwards, requires assumptions and \\n\\n \\n \\n\\x0cConsolidated Financial Statements ___ Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements ___ Operating Activities \\n\\n261 \\n\\nestimates concerning the future taxable income of the respective Group company.

\\n\\n-478 \\n\\n1,411 \\n\\nThe decrease in deferred taxes according to the consolidated balance sheet was due in particular to lower \\ndeductible temporary differences resulting from the remeasurement of the net defined benefit obligation \\nthrough other comprehensive income. This effect was partially offset by the higher level of temporary \\ndifferences on the elimination of intragroup profits.  \\n\\nGiven the positive earnings forecasts, it was assumed that it will be possible to realize recognized deferred tax \\nassets of € 191 million (December 31, 2021: € 82 million), which exceeded deferred tax liabilities relating to \\nthe same taxation authority and the same taxable entity, even though there was a loss in the current or \\nprevious period. \\n\\nFor deductible temporary differences in the amount of € 71 million (December 31, 2021: € 57 million) no \\ndeferred tax assets were recognized in the balance sheet.  \\n\\nDeferred tax liabilities from outside basis differences for planned dividend payouts were recognized in the \\namount of € 79 million (December 31, 2021: € 93 million). Retained earnings of subsidiaries for which no \\ndeferred taxes are recognized amounted to € 10,249 million as of December 31, 2022 (December 31, 2021: \\n€ 8,553 million). The resulting temporary differences that will be taxable in future periods in the event of \\ndividend payments would amount to € 582 million as of December 31, 2022 (December 31, 2021: \\n€ 476 million). \\n\\nIncome tax receivables and income tax liabilities \\n\\nIncome tax receivables amounted to € 456 million as of December 31, 2022 (December 31, 2021: \\n€ 502 million) and mainly resulted from tax prepayments that exceeded the actual amount of tax payable for \\nthe past fiscal year and earlier fiscal years, from refund claims for previous years, and from withholding tax \\nclaims. As of December 31, 2022, income tax liabilities including liabilities for uncertain tax obligations totaled \\n€ 1,522 million (December 31, 2021: € 1,462 million). \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n \\n \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cConsolidated Financial Statements ___ Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements ___ Operating Activities \\n\\n264 \\n\\n(16)  Operating cash flow \\n\\n Accounting and measurement policies  \\n\\nOperating cash flow \\n\\nThe operating cash flow is calculated and presented based on the following principles: \\n\\n•  The operating cash flow is presented using the indirect method based on profit after taxes. \\n\\n•  The option to recognize interest received and interest payments made is exercised to the extent that such \\n\\ntransactions are recognized in cash flow from operating activities.  \\n\\n•  Tax payments are reported in operating cash flow. Only significant transactions where the associated tax \\n\\npayments can be practically calculated are recognized in the relevant item of the consolidated cash flow \\nstatement. \\n\\nTax payments made totaled € 1,344 million in fiscal 2022 (2021: € 1,135 million). Tax refunds received \\namounted to € 145 million (2021: € 90 million).  \\n\\nInterest paid totaled € 185 million (2021: € 216 million). \\n\\n(17)  Earnings per share \\n\\n Accounting and measurement policies  \\n\\nEarnings per share \\n\\nBasic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit after taxes attributable to the shareholders of \\nMerck KGaA (net income) by the weighted average number of theoretical shares outstanding. The calculation of \\nthe theoretical number of shares is based on the fact that the general partner’s equity is not represented by \\nshares. Corresponding to the division of the subscribed capital of € 168 million into 129,242,252 shares (see \\nNote (34) “Equity”), the general partner’s equity of € 397 million equates to 305,535,626 theoretical shares. \\n\\nOverall, equity capital thus amounted to € 565 million or 434,777,878 theoretical shares outstanding. \\n\\nAs in the previous year, equity capital remained unchanged in fiscal 2022. The weighted average (basic) \\nnumber of shares was 434,777,878 and thus corresponded to the number of theoretical shares outstanding. In \\nfiscal 2022 and 2021, there were no shares with a potential diluting effect; as a result, the diluted earnings per \\nshare were equivalent to basic earnings per share.\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cConsolidated Financial Statements ___ Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements ___ Operating Assets, Liabilities, and Contingent Liabilities \\n\\n265 \\n\\nOperating Assets, Liabilities, and Contingent \\nLiabilities \\n\\n(18)  Goodwill \\n\\n Accounting and measurement policies  \\n\\nGoodwill \\n\\nIn the course of business combinations, goodwill is recognized on the acquisition date. The option to measure \\nnon-controlling interests at fair value on the date of their acquisition (full goodwill method) is not utilized. \\n\\nMethod for impairment testing \\n\\nImpairment testing for goodwill takes place at the level of the Life Science, Healthcare, and Electronics business \\nsectors. These groups of cash-generating units (CGUs) are the lowest level at which goodwill at Merck is \\nmonitored for internal management purposes. \\n\\nImpairment testing is performed on a scheduled basis in the third quarter of every year and on an ad hoc basis \\nwhere there are indications of impairment. The existence of indications of impairment may be monitored using \\nvarious factors such as changes in short-term and medium-term planning, sector studies, analyst forecasts, \\nvalidation multiples, and Merck’s average market capitalization compared to its balance sheet equity.  \\n\\nIn the 2022 reporting year, the recoverable amount for the Life Science and Electronics CGUs was primarily \\ndetermined on the basis of the fair value less costs of disposal (2021: on the basis of the value in use). As in \\nthe previous year, the determination of the recoverable amount for the Healthcare CGU in fiscal 2022 was \\nbased on the value in use. \\n\\nFor both fair value less cost of disposal and value in use, the recoverable amount is calculated in accordance \\nwith the discounted cash flow method (Level 3 in the IFRS 13 fair value hierarchy).  \\n\\nIn calculating the fair value, the expected post-tax cash flows are derived from the medium-term plans \\nprepared by the business sectors. Due to extensive investments in the Life Science and Electronics CGUs, the \\nfourth planning year after the detailed planning period for both of these CGUs is extrapolated for an additional \\nfour years in line with business-specific assumptions before being converted to the terminal value by applying a \\nlong-term growth rate (2021: transition to the terminal value after four years starting from the following year). \\nIn the Healthcare CGU, the transition to the terminal value takes place after four years starting from the \\nfollowing year. Sales planning is based on internal past experience and largely non-observable input factors in \\nthe market, such as future market shares, selling prices and volumes, and new products from the development \\npipeline and expansion investments. Profit margins are based on past experience adjusted for expected \\nprofitability developments. \\n\\nIn calculating the value in use, the most recent medium-term plan approved by the Executive Board, with a \\ndetailed planning period of four years starting from the following year, serves as the basis for planning. Sales \\nplanning is based on past experience and assumptions regarding future market shares, selling prices and \\nvolumes. Expected cash inflows and outflows from new products from the Healthcare development pipeline and \\nexpansion investments are not included in the calculation of value in use. Profit margins are based on past \\nexperience adjusted for expected profitability developments.  \\n\\n \\n \\n\\x0cConsolidated Financial Statements ___ Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements ___ Operating Assets, Liabilities, and Contingent Liabilities \\n\\n266 \\n\\nThe discount factor after taxes is derived on the basis of the following input parameters: \\n\\nRisk-free interest rate \\n\\nBeta factor \\n\\nMarket risk premium \\n\\n Derived from the returns of long-term government bonds \\n\\n Derived from the respective sector specific peer group \\n\\nBased on a combination of different estimating methods; e.g. \\nhistorical and implied stock yields \\n\\nCost of debt and capital structure \\n\\n Derived from the market data of the respective peer group companies \\n\\nThe long-term growth rate after the detailed planning period is determined taking into account expected long-\\nterm growth and long-term inflation expectations. \\n\\nSignificant measurement assumptions \\n\\nIn the Life Science CGU, the expected average sales growth in the period until the transition to the terminal \\nvalue was a higher single-digit percentage (2021: higher single-digit percentage in the detailed planning \\nperiod). The sales expectation for ZMGE Life Science is supported primarily by the anticipated long-term \\npositive development in the Process Solutions and Life Science Services business units, based on ongoing high \\nmarket growth and the continuing expansion of the portfolio and production capacities. Taking into account \\nGroup costs allocated on a pro rata basis, the EBITDA pre margin applied was around 34% (2021: around \\n32%). \\n\\nThe expected average sales growth in the Healthcare CGU amounted to a mid single-digit percentage rate in \\nthe detailed planning period (2021: lower single-digit percentage rate). In line with the value-in-use concept, \\nthis did not include net sales from the launch of new products. \\n\\nThe calculation of the recoverable amount of the Electronics CGU included the expected average sales growth in \\nthe period until the transition to the terminal value at a higher single-digit percentage (2021: mid single-digit \\npercentage in the detailed planning period). The sales expectation for ZMGE Electronics results primarily from \\nthe long-term growth trend in the market for semiconductor materials and positive sales contributions from the \\nLevel Up growth program with an investment volume exceeding € 3 billion by the end of 2025. Taking into \\naccount Group costs allocated on a pro rata basis, the EBITDA pre margin applied in impairment testing was \\naround 30% in both fiscal 2022 and 2021. \\n\\nThe additional significant value-relevant assumptions underlying the goodwill impairment tests are quantified \\nbelow. \\n\\nin % \\n\\nLife Science1 \\n\\nHealthcare2  \\n\\nElectronics3  \\n\\nLong-term \\n\\ngrowth rate \\n\\nWeighted cost of capital after \\n\\ntax \\n\\n2022   \\n\\n2021   \\n\\n2022   \\n\\n2021   \\n\\n2.00%   \\n\\n1.75%   \\n\\n0.00%   \\n\\n0.00%   \\n\\n2.00%   \\n\\n1.00%   \\n\\n7.5%   \\n\\n5.6%   \\n\\n7.1%   \\n\\n5.5%   \\n\\n5.5%   \\n\\n5.4%   \\n\\n1 The previous-year weighted cost of capital before taxes to determine the value in use of the CGU  Life Science was 6.7%. \\n\\n2 The weighted cost of capital before taxes to determine the value in use of the CGU  Healthcare for fiscal 2022 was 7.3% (previous-year 7.4%). \\n\\n3 The previous-year weighted cost of capital before taxes to determine the value in use of the CGU  Electronics was 6.7%. \\n\\nThe increase in the long-term growth rate was due in particular to higher expectations with regard to long-term \\ninflation expectations.

Although Merck \\nassumes that the assumptions applied in calculating the recoverable amount are appropriate, changes to these \\nassumptions could result in goodwill impairment with an adverse impact on the net assets, financial position, \\nand results of operations. In the Electronics CGU in particular, there is a high degree of dependence on the \\nassumptions concerning the long-term growth trend in the market for semiconductor materials.  \\n\\nAs in the previous year, the recoverable amount in impairment testing in fiscal 2022 was more than 15% higher \\nthan the carrying amount of the respective CGU for both fair value less cost of disposal and value in use. \\nRegardless of this, the planning data and recoverable amounts applied were checked for plausibility against \\nexternally available analyst assessments and “sum of the parts” calculations and validated using multiples \\nbased on peer group information.  \\n\\nIn addition, sensitivity analyses of the key assumptions were performed as part of the scheduled impairment \\ntests. The following table presents the minimum amount by which individual key assumptions could have \\nchanged when viewed in isolation before the impairment test triggered the recognition of an impairment loss. \\n\\nDecrease in net cash flows \\n\\n  Decrease in long-term growth rate \\n\\nIncrease in cost of capital after tax \\n\\n% \\n\\n2022   \\n\\n>10   \\n\\n>10   \\n\\n>10   \\n\\npercentage points \\n\\npercentage points \\n\\n2021   \\n\\n>10   \\n\\n>10   \\n\\n>10   \\n\\n2022   \\n\\n2021   \\n\\n2022   \\n\\n2021 \\n\\n>2   \\n\\n>2   \\n\\n>2   \\n\\n>2   \\n\\n>2   \\n\\n>2   \\n\\n>2   \\n\\n>2   \\n\\n>2   \\n\\n>2 \\n\\n>2 \\n\\n>2 \\n\\nLife Science \\n\\nHealthcare \\n\\nElectronics \\n\\nGoodwill shown below was incurred mainly in the course of the acquisitions of the Versum Materials Inc., United \\nStates, the Sigma-Aldrich Corporation, United States, the AZ Electronic Materials S.A., Luxembourg, the \\nMillipore Corporation, United States, and the Serono SA, Switzerland. \\n\\nGoodwill \\n\\n€ million \\n\\nLife Science   \\n\\nHealthcare   \\n\\nElectronics   \\n\\nTotal \\n\\nNet carrying amounts, Jan. 1, 2021 \\n\\n10,287   \\n\\n1,525   \\n\\n4,146   \\n\\n15,959 \\n\\nOther additions \\n\\nDisposals due to divestments/Reclassification to assets held \\nfor sale \\n\\nTransfers \\n\\nImpairment losses \\n\\nCurrency translation difference \\n\\n–   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n-4   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n776   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n–   \\n\\nNet carrying amounts as of Dec. 31, 2021 \\n\\n11,059   \\n\\n1,525   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n– \\n\\n– \\n\\n-4 \\n\\n– \\n\\n273   \\n\\n4,420   \\n\\n1,050 \\n\\n17,004 \\n\\nNet carrying amounts, Jan. 1, 2022 \\n\\n11,059   \\n\\n1,525   \\n\\n4,420   \\n\\n17,004 \\n\\nAdditions \\n\\nDisposals due to divestments/Reclassification to assets held \\nfor sale \\n\\nTransfers \\n\\nImpairment losses \\n\\nCurrency translation difference \\n\\n536   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n619   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n46   \\n\\n582 \\n\\n–   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n– \\n\\n– \\n\\n– \\n\\n209   \\n\\n828 \\n\\nNet carrying amounts as of Dec. 31, 2022 \\n\\n12,214   \\n\\n1,525   \\n\\n4,675   \\n\\n18,414 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n \\n \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cConsolidated Financial Statements ___ Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements ___ Operating Assets, Liabilities, and Contingent Liabilities \\n\\n268 \\n\\nThe changes in goodwill caused by foreign exchange rates resulted almost exclusively from translating the \\ngoodwill from the acquisitions of Versum Materials, Inc., United States, the Sigma-Aldrich Corporation, United \\nStates, AZ Electronic Materials S.A., Luxembourg, and the Millipore Corporation, United States, which were \\nmostly denominated in U.S. dollars. \\n\\nGoodwill impairment testing did not give rise to the need to recognize any impairment losses in either fiscal \\n2021 or fiscal 2022. \\n\\nThe additions in fiscal 2022 resulted in particular from the acquisition of Exelead Inc., United States (see Note \\n(6) “Acquisitions and divestments”). \\n\\n(19)  Other intangible assets \\n\\n Accounting and measurement policies  \\n\\nRecognition and initial measurement of purchased intangible assets \\n\\nIn in-licensing, the portion of the consideration paid by Merck to acquire intellectual property is recognized as \\nan intangible asset. If research and development services to be performed by the seller are also agreed in \\nconjunction with the transaction, the related share of consideration is separated and recognized in research and \\ndevelopment expenses in line with the service performance.  \\n\\nContingent consideration linked to milestone payments in connection with the purchase of intangible assets \\narising outside a business combination is recognized as an intangible asset and as a financial liability once the \\nmilestone is reached.  \\n\\nIntangible assets acquired in business combinations are recognized at fair value on the acquisition date. \\n\\nRecognition and initial measurement of internally generated intangible assets \\n\\nOwing to the high level of uncertainty until pharmaceutical products are approved, the criteria for the \\ncapitalization of development costs in accordance with IAS 38 are not met in the Healthcare business sector for \\nthe development of drug candidates. Costs incurred after regulatory approval are insignificant and are therefore \\nnot recognized as intangible assets. In the Life Science and Electronics business sectors, development expenses \\nare capitalized as soon as all the recognition criteria are met and can be verified accordingly. This also includes \\nexpenses that were required for REACH registration. Furthermore, development expenses for internal software \\nprojects and the enhancement of purchased ERP programs are capitalized providing that the relevant criteria \\nhave been fulfilled. \\n\\nSubsequent measurement \\n\\nSubsequent measurement is at amortized cost. \\n\\nPurchased and internally generated intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized using the straight-\\nline method over their useful lives. The useful lives of customer relationships, brand names and trademarks as \\nwell as marketing authorizations, acquired patents, licenses and similar rights, and software are usually \\nbetween three and 24 years. In determining these useful lives, Merck considers factors including the typical \\nproduct life cycles for each asset and publicly available information about the estimated useful lives of similar \\nassets. \\n\\nThe identification of indications of impairment takes place once a year or on an ad hoc basis if warranted with \\nthe involvement of the responsible departments, taking external and internal information sources into \\nconsideration. Merck examines the existence of indications of impairment using various factors, particularly \\ndeviations from sales and earnings forecasts and the analysis of changes in medium-term planning. An \\nimpairment test is performed if there are indications of impairment. In the event of impairment, an impairment \\n\\n \\n \\n\\x0cConsolidated Financial Statements ___ Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements ___ Operating Assets, Liabilities, and Contingent Liabilities \\n\\n269 \\n\\nloss is recognized under other operating expenses. Impairment losses are reversed up to amortized cost and \\nreported in other operating income if the original reasons for impairment no longer apply.  \\n\\nIntangible assets with indefinite useful lives and purchased as well as internally generated intangible assets not \\nyet available for use are not amortized, but rather tested for impairment when a triggering event arises or at \\n\\nleast once a year. \\n\\n Significant discretionary decisions and sources of estimation uncertainty   \\n\\nPurchased intangible assets \\n\\nThe identification and measurement of intangible assets acquired in the course of business combinations are \\nsubject to significant discretion and estimation uncertainty. \\n\\nIn connection with in-licensing agreements in the Healthcare business sector, a discretionary estimate is made \\nof the extent to which upfront payments and milestone payments are remuneration for development services \\nyet to be performed or whether such payments are acquisition costs of an intangible asset to be capitalized. \\n\\nDetermination of useful life \\n\\nSignificant assumptions and estimates are required to determine the appropriate amount of amortization of \\nother intangible assets. This relates in particular to the determination of the underlying useful life. \\n\\nIf the amortization of intangible assets from customer relationships, brands, trademarks, marketing \\nauthorizations, patents, licenses and similar rights, and other had been 10% higher, for example due to \\nshortened useful lives, profit before income tax would have been € 83 million lower in fiscal 2022 (previous \\nyear: € 80 million). \\n\\nIdentification of a need to recognize impairment loss and reverse impairment loss \\n\\nDiscretionary decisions are required in assessing substantial evidence of impairment as well as in identifying the \\nneed to reverse the impairment of other intangible assets. Significant valuation-related assumptions and \\n\\nestimates are also required to calculate the appropriate write-down amount in impairment testing. \\n\\n \\n \\n\\x0cConsolidated Financial Statements ___ Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements ___ Operating Assets, Liabilities, and Contingent Liabilities \\n\\n270 \\n\\n€ million \\n\\nCost as of Jan. 1, 2021 \\n\\nAdditions due to business combinations \\n\\nOther additions \\n\\nDisposals due to divestments/ Reclassification to assets \\nheld for sale \\n\\nOther disposals \\n\\nTransfers \\n\\nCurrency translation \\n\\nDec. 31, 2021 \\n\\nCustomer \\n\\nrelationships, \\n\\nMarketing authorizations, \\n\\nSoftware and \\n\\nbrands and \\n\\npatents, licenses, similar rights, \\n\\ntrademarks \\n\\nand other items   \\n\\nsoftware in \\ndevelopment   \\n\\nTotal \\n\\nFinite useful \\nlife \\n\\nNot yet \\navailable for \\n\\nuse   \\n\\n9,148   \\n\\n11,015   \\n\\n1,086   \\n\\n944   \\n\\n22,193 \\n\\n–   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n-6   \\n\\n3   \\n\\n678   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n103   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n-26   \\n\\n58   \\n\\n154   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n186   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n-12   \\n\\n-39   \\n\\n13   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n85   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n-2   \\n\\n-1   \\n\\n32   \\n\\n– \\n\\n375 \\n\\n– \\n\\n-45 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n878 \\n\\n9,825   \\n\\n11,305   \\n\\n1,235   \\n\\n1,058   \\n\\n23,423 \\n\\nAccumulated amortization and impairment losses as of \\nJan. 1, 2021 \\n\\n-3,211   \\n\\n-10,091   \\n\\n-695   \\n\\n-543   \\n\\n-14,540 \\n\\nDepreciation, amortization, and write-downs \\n\\n-551   \\n\\n-252   \\n\\nImpairment losses \\n\\nReversals of impairment losses \\n\\nDisposals due to divestments/ Reclassification to assets \\nheld for sale \\n\\nOther disposals \\n\\nTransfers \\n\\nCurrency translation \\n\\nDec. 31, 2021 \\n\\n–   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n6   \\n\\n-3   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n21   \\n\\n-13   \\n\\n-229   \\n\\n-108   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n-38   \\n\\n14   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n1   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n-2   \\n\\n-90   \\n\\n-893 \\n\\n-9   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n1   \\n\\n-1   \\n\\n-47 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n– \\n\\n28 \\n\\n-17 \\n\\n-17   \\n\\n-356 \\n\\n-3,989   \\n\\n-10,443   \\n\\n-720   \\n\\n-659   \\n\\n-15,810 \\n\\nNet carrying amounts as of Dec. 31, 2021 \\n\\n5,836   \\n\\n862   \\n\\n515   \\n\\n400   \\n\\n7,612 \\n\\nCost as of Jan. 1, 2022 \\n\\n9,825   \\n\\n11,305   \\n\\n1,235   \\n\\n1,058   \\n\\n23,423 \\n\\nAdditions due to business combinations \\n\\nOther additions \\n\\nDisposals due to divestments/ Reclassification to assets \\nheld for sale \\n\\nOther disposals \\n\\nTransfers \\n\\nCurrency translation \\n\\nDec. 31, 2022 \\n\\n97   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n-17   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n487   \\n\\n63   \\n\\n55   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n-236   \\n\\n23   \\n\\n59   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n166   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n-11   \\n\\n-23   \\n\\n13   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n93   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n-83   \\n\\n4   \\n\\n24   \\n\\n160 \\n\\n314 \\n\\n– \\n\\n-347 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n582 \\n\\n10,391   \\n\\n11,268   \\n\\n1,379   \\n\\n1,096   \\n\\n24,135 \\n\\nAccumulated depreciation and impairment losses as of \\nJan. 1, 2022 \\n\\n-3,989   \\n\\n-10,443   \\n\\n-720   \\n\\n-659   \\n\\n-15,810 \\n\\nDepreciation, amortization, and write-downs \\n\\n-602   \\n\\nImpairment losses \\n\\nReversals of impairment losses \\n\\nDisposals due to divestments/ Reclassification to assets \\nheld for sale \\n\\nOther disposals \\n\\nTransfers \\n\\nCurrency translation \\n\\nDec. 31, 2022 \\n\\n-9   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n17   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n-160   \\n\\n-229   \\n\\n-18   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n231   \\n\\n-14   \\n\\n-36   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n-102   \\n\\n-180   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n15   \\n\\n-1   \\n\\n-3   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n83   \\n\\n-1   \\n\\n-13   \\n\\n-932 \\n\\n-211 \\n\\n– \\n\\n– \\n\\n331 \\n\\n– \\n\\n-211 \\n\\n-4,743   \\n\\n-10,509   \\n\\n-887   \\n\\n-695   \\n\\n-16,833 \\n\\nNet carrying amounts as of Dec. 31, 2022 \\n\\n5,648   \\n\\n759   \\n\\n493   \\n\\n401   \\n\\n7,302 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n \\n \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cConsolidated Financial Statements ___ Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements ___ Operating Assets, Liabilities, and Contingent Liabilities \\n\\n271 \\n\\nAdditions and disposals  \\n\\nAdditions due to business combinations amounted to € 160 million in fiscal 2022 (2021: € 0 million) and were \\nmainly attributable to the acquisition of Exelead Inc., United States, which was completed on \\nFebruary 22, 2022.

Consolidated Financial Statements ___ Operating Assets, Liabilities, and Contingent Liabilities \\n\\n275 \\n\\nThe individual additions to construction in progress in fiscal 2022 with an investment volume of more than \\n€ 30 million are presented below: \\n\\nBusiness sector \\n\\nLife Science \\n\\nLife Science \\n\\nLife Science \\n\\nHealthcare \\n\\n(21)  Leasing \\n\\n Investment project \\n\\n Production plant \\n\\n Filling and logistics center \\n\\n Filtration plant \\n\\n  Country \\n\\n  Germany \\n\\n  Germany \\n\\n  Ireland \\n\\n Biotech development system \\n\\n  Switzerland \\n\\n Accounting and measurement policies  \\n\\nLeasing \\n\\nScope of IFRS 16 \\n\\nMerck exercises the option provided by IFRS 16 to not recognize leases of intangible and low-value assets as \\nleases. Right-of-use assets under leases are reported in the balance sheet item “Property, plant, and \\nequipment” (see Note (20) “Property, plant, and equipment”). \\n\\nWhere the provision of company cars to employees qualifies as an employee benefit within the meaning of \\nIAS 19, IFRS 16 is not applied. In this case, its balance-sheet treatment is governed solely by IAS 19. \\n\\nSeparation of lease and non-lease components \\n\\nLeases for land, land rights and buildings are separated into lease and non-lease components. Merck otherwise \\nelects to exercise the option not to separate non-lease components from lease components. \\n\\nDepreciation of the right-of-use assets arising from leases \\n\\nBasically, right-of-use assets are depreciated over the lease term. If it is considered sufficiently probable that \\nan existing purchase option will be exercised or ownership will be automatically transferred at the end of the \\nlease term, however, depreciation takes place over the period that applies for corresponding assets under \\nproperty, plant, and equipment (see Note (20) “Property, plant, and equipment”). \\n\\nDetermining the incremental borrowing rate \\n\\nIf the interest rate for the lease cannot be reliably determined, the incremental borrowing rate is applied in \\nmeasuring the lease liability. At Merck, the incremental borrowing rate is determined on the basis of the risk-\\nfree interest rate of the respective Group company over a similar term and in the same currency. This interest \\nrate is adjusted using a risk surcharge specific to Merck. Merck applies the repayment model to determine the \\ncurrent portion of the lease. The current portion of the lease corresponds to the repayment share of the next 12 \\nmonths. \\n\\nDetermining the lease term \\n\\nWhere renewal or termination options are available, their exercise is assessed on a case-by-case basis, \\n\\nconsidering factors such as location strategies, leasehold improvements and the degree of specificity. \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n   \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cConsolidated Financial Statements ___ Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements ___ Operating Assets, Liabilities, and Contingent Liabilities \\n\\n276 \\n\\n Significant discretionary decisions and sources of estimation uncertainty   \\n\\nLeasing \\n\\nIdentification of a lease \\n\\nDiscretionary decisions can arise during the identification of leases in answering the question of whether a \\nlessor’s right of substitution is substantive. Merck classifies rights of substitution as not substantive if the facts \\nand circumstances of the case do not support a different assessment. \\n\\nMeasurement of lease and non-lease components \\n\\nIn the case of leases for land, land rights, and buildings, separating the lease into lease and non-lease \\ncomponents is subject to discretion and estimation uncertainty if observable prices are not available from the \\ncontract partner or other potential lessors. \\n\\nDetermining the lease term \\n\\nWhen determining the lease term, existing renewal and termination options must be evaluated to determine the \\nprobability that such options will be exercised. \\n\\nThe assessment of the probability of exercise may be discretionary even though it relies on existing and \\nmaterial information on the general economic context, such as location strategies, leasehold improvements, or \\nthe degree of specificity. If the available information does not allow a reliable assessment, Merck uses historical \\nexperience for comparable situations. \\n\\nThe largest 30 leases accounted for around 50% of total lease liabilities in fiscal 2022 and 2021. They are \\nessentially for right-of-use assets for office, warehouse, and laboratory buildings. If options to renew these \\nleases were exercised in future, which is not yet considered likely, this would result in additional potential \\nundiscounted cash outflows of up to € 219 million (2021: € 145 million). \\n\\nWhere individual contracts include termination options, it was considered unlikely that these would be exercised \\nso that additional lease payments were already considered in the corresponding lease liability. \\n\\nDetermining the incremental borrowing rate \\n\\nDetermining the risk-free interest rate and determining the risk surcharge are both discretionary. \\n\\nInitial measurement of the lease liability and the right-of-use asset \\n\\nIn measuring the lease liability, there is discretionary scope and significant estimation uncertainty regarding \\n\\n•  measuring any payments in the course of promised residual value guarantees and \\n\\n•  assessing the probability that existing purchase, termination and renewal options will be exercised. \\n\\nIn measuring right-of-use assets under leases, Merck is subject to estimation uncertainty regarding any \\n\\ndemolition obligations and their resulting payments. \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n

When determining amortized cost, the “first-in, first-out” (FIFO) and \\nweighted average cost formulas are used. \\n\\nInventories are tested for impairment using a business sector-specific method. Under this method, cost is \\ncompared to the net realizable values. If the net realizable value is lower than the amortized cost, the asset is \\nwritten down by a corresponding amount, which is recognized as an expense in the cost of sales. \\n\\nIn addition to the impairment derived from the sales market, impairment losses may also be necessary for \\nquality reasons or due to a lack of usability of the items or their remaining shelf life. If the reason for \\nimpairment no longer applies, the carrying amount is adjusted to the lower of cost or the new net realizable \\nvalue. \\n\\nSince inventories are, for the most part, not manufactured within the scope of long-term production processes, \\nborrowing costs are not included. \\n\\nInventory prepayments are reported under other non-financial assets. \\n\\n Significant discretionary decisions and sources of estimation uncertainty  \\n\\nIdentification of impairments or reversal of impairments \\n\\nDiscretionary decisions are required in the identification of impairment as well as in identifying the need to \\nreverse impairment of inventories. There are estimation uncertainties with respect to the calculation of the net \\nrealizable value. In particular, changes in selling prices and expected costs of completion are considered in \\n\\ncalculating this value. \\n\\nInventories consisted of the following: \\n\\n€ million \\n\\nRaw materials and supplies \\n\\nWork in progress \\n\\nFinished goods/goods for resale \\n\\nInventories \\n\\n  Dec. 31, 2022    Dec. 31, 20211 \\n\\n1,076   \\n\\n1,418   \\n\\n2,139   \\n\\n4,632   \\n\\n803 \\n\\n798 \\n\\n2,299 \\n\\n3,900 \\n\\n1 The previous year\\'s figures have been adjusted to improve comparability, as the further standardization of the ERP systems in  the Life Science business \\n\\nsector resulted in a different allocation to the individual items in the financial year. \\n\\nThe increase in inventories in fiscal 2022 was driven by all three business sectors. Whereas the upturn in the \\nHealthcare business sector was only minor, the Life Science and Electronics business sectors saw significant \\ngrowth in inventories. This development was driven in particular by the Process Solutions business unit in the \\nLife Science business sector and the Semiconductor Solutions business unit in the Electronics business sector. \\nThe reasons were a need to build up stocks of raw materials and work in progress in order to secure production \\nand supply, as well as delays in global logistics processes.  \\n\\nImpairment losses included in the cost of sales are shown in Note (10) “Cost of sales”. \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n   \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cConsolidated Financial Statements ___ Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements ___ Operating Assets, Liabilities, and Contingent Liabilities \\n\\n281 \\n\\n(25)  Trade and other receivables \\n\\n Accounting and measurement policies  \\n\\nTrade and other receivables \\n\\nTrade accounts receivable without significant financing components that are not the subject of a factoring \\nagreement are measured at the amount of the unconditional claim for consideration on initial recognition.

In particular, the factors influencing this likelihood are: \\n\\n• \\n\\n• \\n\\nthe validity of the arguments brought forward by the opposing party, and \\n\\nthe legal situation and current court rulings in comparable proceedings in the jurisdiction in question. \\n\\nThe following factors are also relevant in measuring provisions for litigation: \\n\\n• \\n\\n• \\n\\n• \\n\\n• \\n\\nthe duration of proceedings in pending legal disputes, \\n\\nthe applicable license rate plus an expected infringement surcharge, \\n\\nthe usual damages and fines for comparable legal disputes, and \\n\\nthe discount factor to be used. \\n\\nProvisions for restructuring \\n\\nMerck uses formal restructuring plans to assess recognition obligation for provisions for restructuring projects \\nand the amount of the expected outflow of resources. \\n\\nProvisions for environmental protection \\n\\nTo assess a recognition obligation in relation to provisions for environmental protection and to quantify future \\noutflows of resources, Merck draws on appraisals by independent external experts and the knowledge of in-\\nhouse specialists. \\n\\nThe following are key parameters in calculating the present value of the future settlement amount of provisions \\nfor environmental protection: \\n\\n• \\n\\n• \\n\\n• \\n\\n• \\n\\n• \\n\\nthe future settlement date, \\n\\nthe extent of environmental damage, \\n\\nthe applicable remediation methods, \\n\\nthe associated future costs, and \\n\\nthe discount factor. \\n\\nProvisions for acceptance and follow-on obligations \\n\\nThe assessment of the recognition obligation for provisions for acceptance and follow-on obligations and the \\nquantification of future outflows of resources is based on internal project plans as well as on the assessment of \\nthe respective matters by in-house and external specialists. \\n\\nThe main parameters in determining the amount of the provision are: \\n\\n• \\n\\n• \\n\\n• \\n\\n• \\n\\nthe ability to use or potential for modification of secured manufacturing capacities at third-party providers, \\nparticularly for pharmaceutical compounds, \\n\\nthe number of affected patients and the expected duration of their continued treatment in clinical \\ndevelopment programs, \\n\\nthe expected date or period of the outflow of resources, and \\n\\nthe expectations concerning future events influencing the obligations. \\n\\n \\n \\n\\x0cConsolidated Financial Statements ___ Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements ___ Operating Assets, Liabilities, and Contingent Liabilities \\n\\n284 \\n\\nProvisions for interest and penalties related to income taxes \\n\\nObjective assessments are performed to determine the need to recognize provisions for interest and penalties \\nrelated to income taxes not covered by IAS 12.  \\n\\n Significant discretion and sources of estimation uncertainty  \\n\\nProvisions for litigation \\n\\nLike the measurement of provisions, the assessment of a recognition obligation for provisions for litigation is to \\na particular extent subject to a degree of estimation uncertainty. The uncertainties relate, in particular, to the \\nassessment of the likelihood and the amount of the outflow of resources. \\n\\nProvisions for restructuring \\n\\nEstimation uncertainty about the provisions for restructuring primarily relate to determining the amount of the \\nexpected outflow of resources. This is largely influenced by the assumptions made concerning the change in or \\ntermination of the employment relationships of the affected employees and the planned implementation date of \\nthe restructuring plan. \\n\\nProvisions for environmental protection \\n\\nThe assessment of a recognition obligation and the measurement of the provisions for environmental protection \\nare subject to discretionary decisions and estimation uncertainties to a particular degree. \\n\\nThe estimation uncertainties relate in particular to the assessment of the timing and likelihood of a future \\noutflow of resources and assessment of the extent of necessary remediation measures and the related \\ncalculation of the amount of the liability. \\n\\nProvisions for acceptance and follow-on obligations \\n\\nEstimation uncertainty regarding the provisions for acceptance and follow-on obligations primarily relates to \\ndetermining the amount of the expected outflow of resources. \\n\\nProvisions for interest and penalties related to income taxes \\n\\nEstimation uncertainty concerning the provisions for interest and penalties related to income taxes mainly \\nrelate to the interpretation of tax codes and the effects of amended case law.  \\n\\nAntitrust and other proceedings \\n\\nThe most important legal matters in the reporting period are detailed below. \\n\\nCitalopram: In connection with the generics business that was divested in 2007, Merck was accused of \\nbreaching EU antitrust law through agreements entered into by its former subsidiary Generics (UK) Ltd., United \\nKingdom, relating to the antidepressant Citalopram patented by Lundbeck A/S, Denmark. The European \\nCommission imposed a fine in June 2013. Merck filed a lawsuit against the Commission’s decision with the \\nEuropean Court (EC) in August 2013. The lawsuit was rejected in 2016. Merck subsequently filed an appeal \\nagainst this decision with the European Court of Justice, which confirmed the first instance ruling in March \\n2021. Although the fine of € 18 million was paid in 2013, additional potential claims were considered to be \\nprobable. A provision in a mid-double-digit million euro amount was recognized for these proceedings as of \\nDecember 31, 2022. A cash outflow within the next twelve months is considered possible. \\n\\nParoxetine: In the United Kingdom, Merck was subject to antitrust investigations by the British Competition and \\nMarket Authority in connection with the generics business that was divested in 2007. In March 2013, the \\nauthorities informed Merck of the assumption that a settlement agreement entered into in 2002 between \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cConsolidated Financial Statements ___ Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements ___ Operating Assets, Liabilities, and Contingent Liabilities \\n\\n285 \\n\\nGenerics (UK) Ltd., United Kingdom, and several subsidiaries of GlaxoSmithKline plc, United Kingdom, in \\nconnection with the antidepressant drug paroxetine, violated British and European competition law and set a \\nfine. They stated that Merck was liable as the then owner of Generics (UK) Ltd. and because it was involved in \\nthe negotiations for the settlement agreement. The investigations into Generics (UK) Ltd. started in 2011, \\nwithout this being known to Merck. After the European Court of Justice confirmed in January 2020 that such \\nsettlement agreements can violate European competition law, the Competition Appeal Tribunal confirmed in \\nMay 2021 the low single-digit million euro fine that Merck paid in September 2021. British National Health \\nServices subsequently asserted claims for damages on account of the anti-competitive settlement agreements \\nin 2002. Merck and the National Health Service for England and Wales agreed on a settlement payment in \\nDecember 2022. The payment was made in January 2023. The previous provision in a low double-digit million \\neuro amount was reversed almost in full.  \\n\\nRestructuring \\n\\nThe restructuring provisions recognized as of December 31, 2022, primarily relate to obligations for workforce \\nreduction measures in connection with communicated restructuring plans in all business sectors. In particular, \\nthis resulted from programs for the reorganization of global research and development activities as well as the \\nsales structures in the Healthcare business sector. \\n\\nOutflows of resources under the restructuring provisions are expected within the next five years. \\n\\nEnvironmental protection \\n\\nProvisions for environmental protection resulted in particular from obligations for soil remediation and \\ngroundwater protection in connection with the crop protection business in Germany and Latin America that was \\ndiscontinued in 1987. \\n\\nAcceptance and follow-on obligations \\n\\nProvisions for acceptance and follow-on obligations primarily related to costs in connection with discontinued \\ndevelopment projects in the Healthcare business sector as well as obligation surpluses from onerous contracts. \\nThe additions and utilizations were mainly due to the discontinuation of development projects under the \\nstrategic alliance with GlaxoSmithKline, United Kingdom (see Note (7) “Collaboration and licensing \\nagreements”), and relate to the winding up of clinical trials. \\n\\nInterest and penalties related to income taxes \\n\\nProvisions for interest and penalties related to income taxes mainly comprised interest payables associated with \\nor resulting from tax payables. \\n\\nMiscellaneous other provisions \\n\\nMiscellaneous other provisions included provisions for asset retirement obligations, for other tax risks not \\nconstituting income tax in accordance with IAS 12, for warranty obligations, and for remaining risks in \\nconnection with the disposal of the Consumer Health business. \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cConsolidated Financial Statements ___ Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements ___ Operating Assets, Liabilities, and Contingent Liabilities \\n\\n286 \\n\\n(28)  Contingent liabilities \\n\\n Accounting and measurement policies  \\n\\nContingent liabilities \\n\\nTo identify contingent liabilities from litigation and tax matters, Merck draws on the knowledge of the legal \\ndepartment and the tax department as well as the opinions of external consultants and attorneys. \\n\\nThe key factors in the identification of contingent liabilities are: \\n\\n• \\n\\nthe validity of the arguments brought forward by the opposing party or the tax authority and \\n\\n• \\n\\nthe legal situation and current court rulings in comparable proceedings in the jurisdiction in question. \\n\\nThe amount of the contingent liability is based on the best possible estimate which in turn is based on likelihood \\n\\nof possible outcomes of proceedings and on the applicable license rate in patent disputes. \\n\\n Significant discretionary decisions and sources of estimation uncertainty  \\n\\nContingent liabilities \\n\\nThe identification and the measurement of contingent liabilities are both subject to considerable uncertainty. \\n\\nThis applies with regard to assessing the likelihood of an outflow of resources as well as determining its \\namount. \\n\\nContingent liabilities in the amount of € 86 million (December 31, 2021: € 109 million) related almost \\nexclusively to litigation and tax matters. \\n\\nContingent liabilities from litigation mainly related to obligations under labor law and tort law. The contingent \\nliabilities from tax matters primarily related to the determination of earnings under tax law, customs \\nregulations, and excise tax matters. \\n\\nIn addition, there were contingent liabilities from various legal disputes with Merck & Co., Inc., United States, of \\nthe United States (outside the United States and Canada: MSD), among other things due to breach of the \\ncoexistence agreement entered into between the two companies and/or trademark/name right infringement \\nregarding the use of the designation “Merck”. In this context, Merck has sued MSD in various countries and has \\nbeen sued by MSD in the United States. An outflow of resources – except costs for legal defense – was not \\ndeemed sufficiently probable as of the balance sheet date to justify the recognition of a provision. Since the \\ncontingent liability from these legal disputes could not be reliably quantified as of the balance sheet date, this \\nmatter was not included in the total figure for contingent liabilities. \\n\\n(29)  Other non-financial liabilities \\n\\n Accounting and measurement policies  \\n\\nOther non-financial liabilities \\n\\nAccruals for personnel expenses included in other non-financial liabilities comprise, in particular, liabilities \\nresulting from vacation entitlements, bonuses and social security contributions. \\n\\nContract liabilities include payments received

\\nassumptions remaining unchanged. \\n\\nBoth the benefit obligations as well as the plan assets are subject to fluctuations over time. The reasons for \\nsuch fluctuations could include changes in market interest rates and thus the discount rate, as well as \\nadjustments to other actuarial assumptions (such as life expectancy or expected future increases in pension). \\nThis could lead to – or cause an increase in – underfunding. Depending on statutory regulations, it may become \\nnecessary in some countries to reduce underfunding through additions of liquid assets.  \\n\\nIn order to minimize fluctuations of the net defined benefit liability, in managing its plan assets, Merck also \\npays attention to potential fluctuations in liabilities. The portfolio is structured in such a way that, in the ideal \\nscenario, plan assets and defined benefit obligations develop in opposing directions when exposed to exogenous \\n\\nfactors. This applies in particular to interest rate fluctuations. \\n\\nDepending on the legal, economic and fiscal circumstances prevailing in each country, different retirement \\nbenefit systems are provided for the employees. Generally, these systems are based on the years of service \\nand salaries of the employees. Pension obligations comprise both obligations from current pensions and accrued \\nbenefits for pensions payable in the future.  \\n\\nNewly hired employees are only offered plans that are not based on final salary.  \\n\\nThe value recognized in the consolidated balance sheet for pensions and other post-employment benefits was \\nderived as follows: \\n\\n€ million \\n\\nPresent value of all defined benefit obligations \\n\\n  Dec. 31, 2022   \\n\\nDec. 31, 2021 \\n\\n4,287   \\n\\n5,995 \\n\\nFair value of the plan assets \\n\\nFunded status \\n\\nEffects of the asset ceilings \\n\\nNet defined benefit liability \\n\\nAssets from defined benefit plans \\n\\nProvisions for pensions and other post-employment benefits \\n\\n-2,634   \\n\\n1,652   \\n\\n-2,999 \\n\\n2,996 \\n\\n33   \\n\\n– \\n\\n1,685   \\n\\n2,996 \\n\\n46   \\n\\n5 \\n\\n1,731   \\n\\n3,001 \\n\\n \\n \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n \\n \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n   \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cConsolidated Financial Statements ___ Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements ___ Employees \\n\\n292 \\n\\nThe reduction was mainly due to the significant rise in the discount factors. \\n\\nThe defined benefit obligations were based on the following types of benefits provided by the respective plan: \\n\\n€ million \\n\\nGermany   \\n\\nSwitzerland   \\n\\nUnited Kingdom   \\n\\nOther countries   \\n\\nTotal \\n\\nDec. 31, 2022 \\n\\nBenefit based on final salary \\n\\nAnnuity \\n\\nLump sum \\n\\nInstallments \\n\\nBenefit not based on final salary \\n\\nAnnuity \\n\\nLump sum \\n\\nInstallments \\n\\nOther \\n\\nMedical plan \\n\\nPresent value of defined benefit \\nobligations \\n\\nFair value of the plan assets \\n\\n2,186   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n2   \\n\\n1   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n555   \\n\\n879   \\n\\n4   \\n\\n5   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n2,752   \\n\\n1,202   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n881   \\n\\n909   \\n\\n327   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n4   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n332   \\n\\n372   \\n\\n72   \\n\\n130   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n62   \\n\\n33   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n5   \\n\\n22   \\n\\n323   \\n\\n152   \\n\\n2,586 \\n\\n130 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n1,496 \\n\\n41 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n4,287 \\n\\n2,634 \\n\\n€ million \\n\\nGermany   \\n\\nSwitzerland    United Kingdom    Other countries   \\n\\nTotal \\n\\nDec. 31, 2021 \\n\\nBenefit based on final salary \\n\\nAnnuity \\n\\nLump sum \\n\\nInstallments \\n\\nBenefit not based on final salary \\n\\nAnnuity \\n\\nLump sum \\n\\nInstallments \\n\\nOther \\n\\nMedical plan \\n\\nPresent value of defined benefit \\nobligations \\n\\nFair value of the plan assets \\n\\n3,016   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n2   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n981   \\n\\n999   \\n\\n1   \\n\\n6   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n4,006   \\n\\n1,308   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n999   \\n\\n946   \\n\\n593   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n6   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n599   \\n\\n570   \\n\\n96   \\n\\n138   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n83   \\n\\n38   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n8   \\n\\n28   \\n\\n391   \\n\\n176   \\n\\n3,705 \\n\\n138 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n2,063 \\n\\n45 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n28 \\n\\n5,995 \\n\\n2,999 \\n\\nThe vast majority of defined benefit obligations of German entities were attributable to plans that encompass \\nold-age, disability, and surviving dependent pensions.

The 2020 tranche reported under current provisions will not \\nbe subject to any value fluctuations between December 31, 2022, and the payout date and was therefore \\n\\nexcluded from the sensitivity analysis (December 31, 2021: exclusion of 2019 tranche). \\n\\nThese share-based compensation programs with cash settlement in place at Merck are aligned with target \\nachievement based on key performance indicators as well as the long-term performance of Merck shares. \\nCertain employees are eligible to receive a certain number of virtual shares – Merck share units (MSUs) – at the \\nend of a three-year performance cycle. The number of MSUs that could be received depends on the individual \\ngrant defined for the respective person and the average closing price of Merck shares in Xetra® trading during \\nthe last 60 trading days prior to January 1 of the respective performance cycle (reference price). When the \\nthree-year performance cycle ends, the number of MSUs to then be granted is determined based on the \\ndevelopment of defined financial key performance indicators (KPIs). In addition to the financial KPIs, a \\nsustainability factor is included in performance measurement for the tranche issued in fiscal 2022.  \\n\\nThe calculation is based on the performance of the Merck share price compared to the performance of the DAX® \\nwith a weighting of 50%, the development of the EBITDA pre margin during the performance cycle as a \\nproportion of a defined target value with a weighting of 25%, and the development of organic sales growth as a \\nproportion of a defined target value, also with a weighting of 25%. Depending on the development of these \\nfinancial KPIs, at the end of the respective performance cycle the eligible participants are granted between 0% \\nand 150% of the MSUs they could be eligible to receive. \\n\\nFor the tranche issued in fiscal 2022, the MSUs measured on the basis of financial targets are multiplied by a \\nsustainability factor composed of the three sustainability criteria: “Dedicated to human progress” (20% \\nweighting), “Creating sustainable value chains” (40% weighting), and “Reducing our ecological footprint” (40% \\nweighting). This factor can range from 0.8 to 1.2. This means that, depending on the result of the financial KPIs \\n(0% to -150%) and the sustainability factor, the eligible participants are granted between 0% and 180% of the \\nMSUs they could be eligible to receive at the end of the respective performance cycle.  \\n\\nA cash payment is made based on the MSUs granted after the three-year performance cycle has ended. The \\nvalue of a granted MSU, which is relevant for payment, corresponds to the average closing price of Merck \\nshares in Xetra® trading during the last 60 trading days prior to the end of the performance cycle. The payout \\namounts of the respective tranches are limited to two and a half times the individual grant. \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n \\n \\n   \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cConsolidated Financial Statements ___ Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements ___ Employees \\n\\n298 \\n\\nThe following table presents the key parameters as well as the development of the potential number of Merck \\nshare units (MSUs) for the individual tranches: \\n\\nPerformance cycle \\n\\nTerm \\n\\nReference price of Merck shares in € (60-day average Merck share price prior to \\nthe start of the performance cycle) \\n\\nDAX® value (60-day average of the DAX® prior to the start of the performance \\ncycle) \\n\\n2020 tranche   \\n\\n2021 tranche   \\n\\n2022 tranche \\n\\nJan. 1, 2020 - \\nDec. 31, 2022 \\n\\nJan. 1, 2021 - \\nDec. 31, 2023 \\n\\nJan. 1, 2022 - \\nDec. 31, 2024 \\n\\n3 Years   \\n\\n3 Years   \\n\\n3 Years \\n\\n105.52   \\n\\n132.43   \\n\\n212.16 \\n\\n12,971.22   \\n\\n12,995.23   \\n\\n15,684.57 \\n\\nPotential number of MSU \\n\\nPotential number offered for the first time in 2020 \\n\\nForfeited \\n\\nPaid out \\n\\nDec. 31, 2020 \\n\\nPotential number offered for the first time in 2021 \\n\\nForfeited \\n\\nPaid out \\n\\nDec. 31, 2021 \\n\\nPotential number offered for the first time in 2022 \\n\\nForfeited \\n\\nPaid out \\n\\nDec. 31, 2022 \\n\\n871,700   \\n\\n33,825   \\n\\n217   \\n\\n837,658   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n685,700   \\n\\n74,364   \\n\\n2,006   \\n\\n41,813   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n761,288   \\n\\n643,887   \\n\\n– \\n\\n– \\n\\n– \\n\\n– \\n\\n– \\n\\n– \\n\\n– \\n\\n– \\n\\n–   \\n\\n47,168   \\n\\n2,510   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n509,033 \\n\\n40,704   \\n\\n1,253   \\n\\n20,282 \\n\\n227 \\n\\n711,610   \\n\\n601,930   \\n\\n488,524 \\n\\nThe value of the provisions as of December 31, 2022, was € 254 million (December 31, 2021: € 348 million). \\nNet expenses of € 70 million were incurred in fiscal 2022 (2021: net expenses of € 249 million).

Merck KG and Merck KGaA, determined in \\naccordance with the provisions of the German Commercial Code. These figures are adjusted for trade tax \\nand/or corporation tax and create the basis for the allocation of net profit/loss. The adjustment for corporation \\ntax is made to compensate for the difference in the tax treatment between the general partner and the limited \\nliability shareholders. Corporation tax is only calculated on the income received by the limited liability \\nshareholders. Its equivalent is the income tax applicable to the partners of E. Merck KG which must be paid by \\nthem directly. The adjustment thus ensures that the share in net profit corresponds to the respective interests \\nheld by the two shareholder groups. \\n\\nThe reciprocal net profit/loss transfer between E.

Merck KG, on which the appropriation of profits adjusted for trade tax is based, amounted to \\n€ 23 million (2021: € 19 million). This resulted in a profit transfer to Merck KGaA of € 7 million (2021: \\n€ 6 million). Merck KGaA’s net income adjusted for corporation tax, on which the appropriation of its profit is \\nbased, amounted to € 974 million (2021: € 1,065 million). Merck KGaA transferred a profit of € 684 million to \\nE. Merck KG (2021: € 748 million). In addition, an expense from corporation tax charges was reported in the \\namount of € 54 million (2021: expense of € 33 million).    \\n\\nAppropriation of profits \\n\\nThe profit distribution to be resolved by shareholders also defines the amount of that portion of net profit/loss \\nfreely available to E. Merck KG. If the shareholders resolve to carry forward or to allocate to retained earnings a \\nportion of Merck KGaA’s net retained profit to which they are entitled, E. Merck KG shall be obliged to allocate \\nto the profit carried forward/retained earnings of Merck KGaA a comparable sum determined according to the \\nratio of subscribed capital to general partner’s equity. This ensures that the retained earnings and the profit \\ncarried forward by Merck KGaA correspond to the ownership ratios of the shareholders on the one hand and \\nE. Merck KG on the other hand. Consequently, for distributions to E. Merck KG, the available amount is the \\namount that results from netting the profit transfer of Merck KGaA with the amount either allocated or \\nwithdrawn by E. Merck KG from retained earnings/profit carried forward. This amount corresponds to the sum \\npaid as a dividend to the shareholders and reflects their pro rata shareholding in the company.  \\n\\nBased on the profit transfer, the appropriation of profits by Merck KGaA was as follows: \\n\\n€ million \\n\\nNet income \\n\\nProfit carried forward previous year \\n\\nWithdrawal from revenue reserves \\n\\nTransfer to revenue reserves \\n\\nRetained earnings limited liability shareholders \\n\\nWithdrawal by E.

This mainly related to cash and cash equivalents at subsidiaries that are subject to capital \\ncontrols. \\n\\nThe maximum default risk was equivalent to the carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents. \\n\\n(36)  Other financial assets \\n\\n Accounting and measurement policies  \\n\\nOther financial assets \\n\\nThis section does not cover the accounting and measurement policies for derivative financial instruments. They \\nare presented in Note (39) “Derivative financial instruments”. \\n\\nRecognition and initial measurement \\n\\nFinancial assets are initially measured at fair value and recognized as of the settlement date. For financial \\nassets not subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss in subsequent periods, initial \\nmeasurement also includes directly attributable transaction costs. Any difference between the fair value of a \\nfinancial instrument on initial recognition (Level 2 and 3) and the transaction price is recognized in income \\nusing the straight-line method over the duration. \\n\\nDetailed information on the measurement methods for financial assets measured at fair value are presented in \\nNote (43) “Information on fair value measurement”. \\n\\nClassification and subsequent measurement \\n\\nOn initial recognition, financial assets are assigned to one of the following measurement categories which also \\ncorrespond to the financial instrument classes as defined in IFRS 9: \\n\\n•  subsequent measurement at amortized cost, \\n\\n•  subsequent measurement at fair value through other comprehensive income, or \\n\\n•  subsequent measurement at fair value through profit or loss. \\n\\nThis classification is based on the business model and the structure of contractual payment flows. Financial \\nassets subsequently measured at amortized cost are accounted for using the effective interest method and \\nconsidering any impairment losses. The procedure for calculating impairment losses is described in Note  \\n(42) “Management of financial risks”. Financial assets of this class are held in order to collect their contractual \\ncash flows, which are exclusively principal repayments and interest payments on the outstanding capital \\namount. \\n\\nExcept for derivative financial instruments with positive market value, Merck only applies subsequent \\nmeasurement at fair value through profit or loss for debt instruments with contractual properties resulting in \\ncash flows that do not exclusively represent principal repayments and interest payments on the outstanding \\ncapital amount. In particular, this includes contingent consideration that was contractually agreed with the \\nacquirer within the context of the disposal of businesses within the meaning of IFRS 3 (see Note \\n(43) “Information on fair value measurement”). Merck does not utilize the option of the subsequent \\nmeasurement of debt instruments at fair value through profit or loss. \\n\\n \\n \\n\\x0cConsolidated Financial Statements ___ Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements ___ Capital Structure, Investments, and Financing Activities \\n\\n304 \\n\\nEquity instruments not subject to mandatory subsequent measurement at fair value through profit or loss are \\nmeasured at fair value through other comprehensive income in subsequent periods if they are intended to be \\nheld for the longer term. Further details on the measurement of equity instruments at fair value are presented \\nin Note (43) “Information on fair value measurement”. \\n\\nFinancial assets are only reclassified in the rare event of Merck changing its business model with regard to the \\nmanagement of financial assets. \\n\\nDerecognition \\n\\nFinancial assets are derecognized if the claim for compensation is fulfilled by the other counterparty, if there is \\nno longer a reasonable expectation that the counterparty will fulfill its contractual obligations, or if Merck \\ntransfers the contractual rights including all material risks and rewards of the financial asset to another \\ncounterparty. \\n\\nRecognition \\n\\nThe following table provides details on the measurement effects of debt instruments on the

hybrid bonds issued by Merck KGaA are bonds for which the leading rating agencies have given equity \\ncredit treatment to half of the issuances, thus making the issuances more favorable to Merck’s credit rating \\nthan traditional bond issues. The bonds are recognized in full as financial liabilities in the balance sheet. \\n\\nA partial buyback of the nominal volume of € 250 million of the hybrid bond issued in 2019 took place on \\nSeptember 9, 2022. \\n\\nThe financial debt was not secured by liens or similar forms of collateral. The loan agreements do not contain \\nany financial covenants. The average borrowing cost on December 31, 2022, was 1.9% (December 31, 2021: \\n1.7%). \\n\\nNon-current liabilities to related parties in the amount of € 660 million relate to loans from E. Merck \\nBeteiligungen KG.  \\n\\nInformation on liabilities to related parties can be found in Note (45) “Related party disclosures”. \\n\\nCapital management \\n\\nThe objective of capital management is to ensure the necessary financial flexibility in order to maintain long-\\nterm business operations and realize strategic options. Maintaining a stable investment grade rating, ensuring \\nliquidity, limiting financial risks, as well as optimizing the cost of capital are the objectives of our financial policy \\nand set important framework conditions for capital management. In this context, net financial debt is an \\nimportant capital management indicator at Merck. \\n\\nTraditionally, the capital market represents a major source of financing for Merck, for instance via bond issues. \\nAs of December 31, 2022, there were liabilities of € 4.5 billion from a debt issuance program most recently \\nrenewed in fiscal 2022 (December 31, 2021: € 4.05 billion). In addition, Merck had access to a commercial \\npaper program to meet short-term capital requirements with a volume of € 2 billion, none of which was utilized \\nas of December 31, 2022, or the prior-year reporting date. \\n\\nLoan agreements represent a further source of financing for Merck. On the balance sheet date, the bank \\nfinancing commitments in respect of Merck were as follows: \\n\\n€ million \\n\\nSyndicated loan \\n\\nBilateral credit agreement \\nwith banks \\n\\nVarious bank credit lines \\n\\nDec. 31, 2022 \\n\\nDec. 31, 2021 \\n\\nFinancing \\ncommitments \\n\\nFinancing \\ncommitments \\n\\nfrom banks   \\n\\nUtilization   \\n\\nfrom banks   \\n\\nUtilization   \\n\\n2,500   \\n\\n375   \\n\\n203   \\n\\n3,078   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n203   \\n\\n203   \\n\\n2,000   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n36   \\n\\n2,036   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n36   \\n\\n36   \\n\\nMaturity of \\n\\nfinancing \\n\\nInterest \\n\\ncommitments \\n\\nvariable   \\n\\n2027 \\n\\nvariable   \\n\\n< 3 years \\n\\nvariable   \\n\\n< 1 year \\n\\nThere were no indications that the availability of extended credit lines was restricted. \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cConsolidated Financial Statements ___ Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements ___ Capital Structure, Investments, and Financing Activities \\n\\n309 \\n\\n(38)  Other financial liabilities \\n\\n Accounting and measurement policies  \\n\\nOther financial liabilities \\n\\nWith the exception of liabilities from derivatives and contingent considerations, which are recognized in the \\ncontext of business combinations according to IFRS 3, other financial liabilities are initially measured at fair \\nvalue and in subsequent periods at amortized cost, applying the effective interest method.

Merck KG. \\n\\n(39)  Derivative financial instruments \\n\\n Accounting and measurement policies   \\n\\nDerivative financial instruments \\n\\nThe IFRS 9 provisions are applied for hedge accounting. Hedging transactions are entered into for highly \\nprobable forecast transactions in foreign currencies and for hedging fair values of assets on the balance sheet. \\nCash flow hedge accounting for forecast transactions in foreign currency means the hedged item is recognized \\nat a fixed exchange rate on a net basis instead of being recognized at the spot exchange rate at the transaction \\ndate. As a result of hedging fair values of assets on the balance sheet, the compensating changes in value of \\nthe corresponding hedged item and hedging instrument offset each other. \\n\\nMerck only uses derivatives as hedging instruments. Merck uses the dollar offset method as well as regression \\nanalyses to measure hedge effectiveness. \\n\\nHedging ineffectiveness may occur in the timing of forecast cash flows or if hedged items are dissolved. \\nDerivatives that do not or no longer meet the documentation or effectiveness requirements for hedge \\naccounting, whose hedged item no longer exists, or for which hedge accounting rules are not applied are \\nclassified as “financial assets or liabilities at fair value through profit or loss” depending on their balance. \\n\\nIn the case of hedging relationships where Merck uses options as hedging instruments, only the intrinsic value \\nof options is designated as the hedging instrument. Changes in the fair value of the time value component of \\noptions that are used for hedge accounting are recognized in other comprehensive income and in the cost of \\ncash flow hedge reserve within equity. The subsequent accounting of these amounts depends on the type of \\nhedged transaction. \\n\\nIn the case of hedging relationships where Merck uses forward contracts as hedging instruments, only the spot \\nelement is designated as the hedging instrument.

Merck aggregates these Group-wide risks and steers them centrally, partly by using \\nderivative financial instruments. To estimate existing risks of foreign exchange and interest rate fluctuations, \\nMerck uses scenario analyses. Merck is not subject to any material risk concentration from financial \\ntransactions.  \\n\\nMerck uses marketable forward exchange contracts, options and interest swaps as hedging instruments. The \\nstrategy to hedge interest rate and foreign exchange rate fluctuations arising from forecast transactions and \\ntransactions already recognized in the balance sheet is set by a risk committee, which meets on a regular basis. \\nThe use of derivatives is regulated by extensive guidelines and subject to ongoing risk controls by Group \\nTreasury. Speculation is prohibited. The strict separation of functions between trading, settlement and control \\nfunctions is ensured. Derivatives are only entered into with banks that have a good credit rating. Related \\ndefault risks are continuously monitored. \\n\\nThe Report on Risks and Opportunities included in the combined management report provides further \\ninformation on the management of financial risks. \\n\\nForeign exchange risks \\n\\nOwing to the international nature of its business, Merck is exposed to transactional foreign exchange risks \\nwithin the scope of both its business activities and financing activities. Foreign exchange risks are continuously \\nanalyzed and different hedging strategies used to limit or eliminate these risks. \\n\\nThe entire foreign exchange exposure is divided into several defined subsets with different risk profiles and \\nsystematically hedged using suitable hedging instruments. Hedging is performed based on a regularly reviewed \\nbasket of currencies. The maximum time horizon for hedging is twelve months.  \\n\\nForeign exchange risks from the following transactions are economically hedged through the use of foreign \\nexchange contracts and currency options:  \\n\\n• \\n\\nintragroup financing in non-functional currency; and \\n\\n• \\n\\nreceivables from and liabilities to third parties in non-functional currency. \\n\\nForeign exchange risks from the following transactions are hedged using foreign exchange contracts and \\ncurrency options applying hedge accounting:  \\n\\n• \\n\\nforecast transactions in non-functional currency, the expected probability of which is very high for the next \\ntwelve months; and \\n\\n• \\n\\nfirm purchase commitments over the next twelve months in non-functional currency. \\n\\n \\n \\n\\x0cConsolidated Financial Statements ___ Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements ___ Capital Structure, Investments, and Financing Activities \\n\\n317 \\n\\nThe following table shows the net exposure and the effects of transactional exchange rate movements of the \\nkey currencies against the euro in relation to the net income and equity of the Group on the balance sheet \\ndate: \\n\\nDecember 31, 2022 \\n\\n€ million \\n\\nNet exposure \\n\\nExchange rate -10% \\n(appreciation vs. €) \\n\\nExchange rate +10% \\n(depreciation vs. €) \\n\\nDecember 31, 2021 \\n\\n€ million \\n\\nNet exposure \\n\\nExchange rate -10% \\n(appreciation vs. €) \\n\\nExchange rate +10% \\n(depreciation vs. €) \\n\\nCHF   \\n\\nCNY \\n\\nJPY \\n\\nKRW   \\n\\nTWD \\n\\nUSD \\n\\nConsolidated income statement   \\n\\n-59   \\n\\n  Equity (other comprehensive income)   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n-591   \\n\\n997   \\n\\n100   \\n\\n-61   \\n\\n16   \\n\\n-9   \\n\\nConsolidated income statement   \\n\\n59   \\n\\n-100   \\n\\n-16   \\n\\n  Equity (other comprehensive income)   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n42   \\n\\n7   \\n\\n22   \\n\\n-17   \\n\\n-22   \\n\\n14   \\n\\n867 \\n\\n87 \\n\\n15   \\n\\n-15   \\n\\n-182 \\n\\n-15   \\n\\n12   \\n\\n-87 \\n\\n141 \\n\\n163   \\n\\n216   \\n\\n151   \\n\\nCHF   \\n\\nCNY   \\n\\nJPY   \\n\\nKRW   \\n\\nTWD   \\n\\nUSD \\n\\n-665   \\n\\n1,086   \\n\\n108   \\n\\n208   \\n\\n126   \\n\\n1,116 \\n\\nConsolidated income statement   \\n\\n-67   \\n\\n  Equity (other comprehensive income)   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n109   \\n\\n-15   \\n\\n11   \\n\\n-9   \\n\\nConsolidated income statement   \\n\\n67   \\n\\n-109   \\n\\n-11   \\n\\n  Equity (other comprehensive income)   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n41   \\n\\n7   \\n\\n21   \\n\\n-10   \\n\\n-21   \\n\\n9   \\n\\n13   \\n\\n-14   \\n\\n-13   \\n\\n11   \\n\\n112 \\n\\n-120 \\n\\n-112 \\n\\n116 \\n\\nIn this presentation, effects of cash flow hedges are taken into consideration in the equity of the Group. The net \\nexposure of each of the above currencies consisted of the following components: \\n\\n•  planned cash flows in the next twelve months in the respective currency, less \\n\\n• \\n\\nthe nominal values of hedging instruments of these planned cash flows. \\n\\nThe planned cash flows in the next twelve months are analyzed and divided into subsets in accordance with the \\nrisk management strategy. In the first subset, 25% of a regularly reviewed basket of currencies is hedged. The \\nsecond subset hedges a more flexible basket of currencies selected on the basis of hedging costs and \\ncorrelation with the euro. The hedging strategy achieves an economic hedge ratio of at least 40% across all \\nhedging subsets. Depending on scenario analyses, this can be increased to up to 90% using a rule-based \\napproach. As in the previous year, balance sheet items in the above currencies were economically hedged by \\nderivatives in full if they did not correspond to the functional currency of the respective Group company. \\nAccordingly, they do not affect the net exposure presented above. \\n\\n \\n \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cConsolidated Financial Statements ___ Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements ___ Capital Structure, Investments, and Financing Activities \\n\\n318 \\n\\nThe impact of cash flow hedge accounting for forecast transactions in foreign currency was as follows for the \\nmajor currencies: \\n\\nDecember 31, 2022 \\n\\n€ million \\n\\nNotional amount \\n\\nthereof: current \\n\\nthereof: non-current \\n\\nFair Value of the hedging instrument \\n\\nthereof: positive market values \\n\\nthereof: negative market values \\n\\nMaturity profile \\n\\nHedge ratio1 \\n\\nChange in value of outstanding hedging \\ninstruments since January 1, 2021 \\n\\nChange in value of hedged item used to \\ndetermine hedge effectiveness since \\nJanuary 1, 2021 \\n\\nCNY   \\n\\n933   \\n\\n933   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n8   \\n\\n10   \\n\\n-2   \\n\\nJPY   \\n\\nKRW   \\n\\nTWD   \\n\\nUSD \\n\\n92   \\n\\n92   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n2   \\n\\n2   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n158   \\n\\n158   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n-3   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n-3   \\n\\n134   \\n\\n134   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n5   \\n\\n5   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n3,408 \\n\\n3,408 \\n\\n– \\n\\n10 \\n\\n45 \\n\\n-34 \\n\\nJanuary 2023 – \\nDecember \\n2023 \\n\\nJanuary 2023 – \\nDecember \\n2023 \\n\\nJanuary 2023 – \\nDecember \\n2023 \\n\\nJanuary 2023 – \\nDecember \\n2023 \\n\\nJanuary 2023 – \\nDecember \\n2023 \\n\\n1:1   \\n\\n8   \\n\\n1:1   \\n\\n2   \\n\\n1:1   \\n\\n-3   \\n\\n1:1   \\n\\n5   \\n\\n-8   \\n\\n-2   \\n\\n3   \\n\\n-5   \\n\\n1:1 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n-10 \\n\\nWeighted average hedging rate \\n\\n7.32   \\n\\n136.00   \\n\\n1,373.00   \\n\\n31.16   \\n\\n1.07 \\n\\n1 The hedging instruments and the corresponding hedged items were denominated in the same currency, therefore the hedge ratio w as 1:1. \\n\\nDecember 31, 2021 \\n\\n€ million \\n\\nNotional amount \\n\\nthereof: current \\n\\nthereof: non-current \\n\\nFair value of the hedging instrument \\n\\nthereof: positive market values \\n\\nthereof: negative market values \\n\\nMaturity profile \\n\\nHedge ratio1 \\n\\nChange in value of outstanding hedging \\ninstruments since January 1, 2020 \\n\\nChange in value of hedged item used to \\ndetermine hedge effectiveness since \\nJanuary 1, 2020 \\n\\nCNY   \\n\\n1,445   \\n\\n1,445   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n-18   \\n\\n13   \\n\\n-31   \\n\\nJPY   \\n\\n126   \\n\\n126   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n–   \\n\\nKRW   \\n\\n114   \\n\\n114   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n-1   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n-1   \\n\\nTWD   \\n\\n180   \\n\\n180   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n-5   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n-5   \\n\\nUSD \\n\\n2,975 \\n\\n2,975 \\n\\n– \\n\\n-32 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n-42 \\n\\nJanuary 2022 – \\nDecember \\n2022 \\n\\nJanuary 2022 – \\nDecember \\n2022 \\n\\nJanuary 2022 – \\nDecember \\n2022 \\n\\nJanuary 2022 – \\nDecember \\n2022 \\n\\nJanuary 2022 – \\nDecember \\n2022 \\n\\n1:1   \\n\\n-18   \\n\\n18   \\n\\n1:1   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n1:1   \\n\\n-1   \\n\\n1:1   \\n\\n-5   \\n\\n1   \\n\\n5   \\n\\n1:1 \\n\\n-32 \\n\\n32 \\n\\nWeighted average hedging rate \\n\\n7.79   \\n\\n130.30   \\n\\n1,367.00   \\n\\n32.27   \\n\\n1.16 \\n\\n1 The hedging instruments and the corresponding hedged items were denominated in the same currency, therefore the hedge ratio w as 1:1. \\n\\nIn addition to the transactional foreign exchange risks described previously, currency translation risks resulted \\nfrom the fact that many of Merck’s subsidiaries are located outside the euro area and have functional currencies \\nother than the reporting currency.

Financial Statements ___ Capital Structure, Investments, and Financing Activities \\n\\n321 \\n\\nCredit risks \\n\\nCredit risk for Merck means the risk of a financial loss if a customer or other contract partner is not able to \\nmeet its contractual payment obligations. Merck is exposed to credit risks mainly due to existing trade accounts \\nreceivable, other receivables, other debt instruments, derivatives and contract assets. \\n\\nCredit risks are monitored on an ongoing basis. The risks arising from extending credit to customers or \\nsuppliers and in the course of other business relationships are also managed. \\n\\nMerck analyzes all trade accounts receivable that are more than 90 days past due in order to establish whether \\ndefault exists. In addition, all other financial instruments that are more than 30 days past due are examined in \\norder to establish whether there has been a significant increase in the credit risk. Both methods are used to \\nexamine whether there is objective evidence of an impairment requiring the recognition of additional loss \\nallowances. \\n\\n Accounting and measurement policies  \\n\\nCredit risks \\n\\nImpairment of trade accounts receivable and contract assets \\n\\nMerck uses the simplified impairment model for trade accounts receivable and contract assets, pursuant to \\nwhich any credit losses expected to occur over the entire lifetime of an asset are taken into account. In order to \\nmeasure expected credit losses, the assets are grouped based on the existing credit risk structure and the \\nrespective maturity structure. \\n\\nThe customer groups with comparable default risks to be considered are determined according to the specific \\nbusiness sector and the place of business of the respective customers. \\n\\nThe expected credit loss rates used in the simplified impairment model are derived on the basis of past default \\nrates and current macroeconomic expectations. In doing so, country-specific ratings are taken into \\nconsideration since many of Merck’s customers depend directly or indirectly on the economic trends in the \\ncountry where their place of business is located (public and private healthcare systems, universities, and \\nresearch companies from within the pharmaceutical industry, as well as industries subsidized under \\ndevelopment plans, particularly in Asia). These country ratings are aggregated into three separate rating \\ngroups. Under the impairment model, past default rates and country ratings are used as an approximation of \\nthe defaults to be expected in the future. \\n\\nWhen a country’s rating changes, the historical default rates of the rating group to which the respective country \\nhas been reallocated have to be applied accordingly, rather than the historical default rates of the previous \\nrating group. \\n\\nIf there is objective evidence that certain trade accounts receivable or contract assets are fully or partially \\nimpaired, additional loss allowances are recognized to account for expected credit losses. \\n\\nA default generally exists when the debtor cannot fully meet its liabilities. \\n\\nA debtor’s creditworthiness is assumed to be impaired if there are objective indications that the debtor is in \\nfinancial difficulties, such as the disappearance of an active market for its products or impending insolvency. On \\ninitial recognition, the lifetime expected credit losses are deducted from the nominal amount of trade accounts \\nreceivable considered as originated credit-impaired financial assets. \\n\\n \\n \\n\\x0cConsolidated Financial Statements ___ Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements ___ Capital Structure, Investments, and Financing Activities \\n\\n322 \\n\\nImpairment of other receivables \\n\\nThe general three-stage impairment model and the simplified approach are used to recognize loss allowances of \\nfinancial instruments included in other receivables. The individual credit rating of the contract partner is used to \\ndetermine the impairment loss of other receivables. \\n\\nIndividual cases are also analyzed to ascertain whether objective findings suggest that the value of other \\nreceivables is impaired. Such suggestions may include, for example, economic difficulties of the debtor, \\ncontractual breaches, or the renegotiation of contractual payment obligations. If the analysis concludes there is \\na substantially increased risk of default, the expected credit loss is calculated over the entire lifetime. \\n\\nImpairment of other financial assets \\n\\nInvestments in debt instruments subsequently measured either at amortized cost or at fair value through other \\ncomprehensive income are fundamentally considered to be investments with low risk, meaning that the \\nexpected credit loss in the upcoming twelve months is used to determine the impairment loss. \\n\\nFor financial assets with only a minimal default risk, the rules concerning the mandatory recognition of a risk \\nprovision for the lifetime expected credit loss are not applied at initial recognition or during subsequent \\nmeasurement. Therefore, no assessment of whether there has been a significant increase in the credit risk is \\ncarried out for such assets. Merck does not presume an increased credit risk as of the balance sheet date if the \\ncontract partner has an investment grade rating. \\n\\nIf there are indications that the debtor’s creditworthiness had worsened but that this was not yet reflected in its \\nexisting credit rating, the credit risk assessment is adjusted and the impairment allowances recognized for \\nexpected credit losses are increased. In all other cases, there are no new risk assessments as of the balance \\nsheet date and the risk profile initially assumed is maintained. \\n\\nWherever a considerable increase in the default risk is assumed, the lifetime expected credit loss of the \\nfinancial asset is considered. \\n\\nOn the balance sheet date, the theoretical maximum default risk for all items referenced above corresponds to \\n\\nthe net carrying amounts less any compensation from credit insurance. \\n\\n Significant discretionary decisions and sources of estimation uncertainty  \\n\\nCredit risks \\n\\nImpairment of trade accounts receivable and contract assets \\n\\nIn terms of the impairment of trade accounts receivable and of contract assets, there is significant discretion \\nand estimation uncertainty regarding: \\n\\n• \\n\\nthe identification of customer groups with identical default risks, \\n\\n• \\n\\nthe identification of a substantial increase in the credit risk, and \\n\\n• \\n\\nthe calculation of the expected credit losses. \\n\\nImpairment of other financial assets \\n\\nDiscretionary judgment is applied in determining individual impairment allowances. \\n\\n \\n \\n\\x0cConsolidated Financial Statements ___ Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements ___ Capital Structure, Investments, and Financing Activities \\n\\n323 \\n\\nThe following table shows impairments for financial assets from operative transactions and contract assets as \\nwell as gains from their reversals recognized in the consolidated income statement: \\n\\n€ million \\n\\nImpairment losses \\n\\nof trade accounts receivable \\n\\nof contract assets \\n\\nof debt instruments subsequently measured at amortized cost \\n\\nof debt instruments subsequently measured at fair value through other comprehensive income  \\n\\n2022   \\n\\n2021 \\n\\n-6   \\n\\n-7   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n1   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n1 \\n\\n1 \\n\\n– \\n\\n– \\n\\n– \\n\\nThe loss allowances and reversals recognized for trade accounts receivable as shown above applied entirely to \\nreceivables resulting from contracts with customers. \\n\\nCredit risks from trade accounts receivable \\n\\nThe credit risk from trade accounts receivable is largely impacted by the specific circumstances of individual \\ncustomers. Merck also considers additional factors such as the general default risk in the respective industry \\nand country in which the customer operates. \\n\\nThe credit risk of customers is assessed using established credit management processes that take individual \\ncustomer risks into account. This is done in particular by analyzing the aging structure of trade accounts \\nreceivable. \\n\\nMerck continuously reviews and monitors the open positions of all its customers in the corresponding countries \\nand takes steps to mitigate credit risks if necessary. \\n\\nThe tables below contain an overview of the credit risk by business sector and country rating as established by \\nleading rating agencies: \\n\\nDecember 31, 2022 \\n\\n€ million \\n\\nLife Science   \\n\\nHealthcare   \\n\\nElectronics   \\n\\nOther \\n\\nGroup \\n\\nExternal rating of at least A- or comparable \\n\\nExternal rating of at least BBB- or comparable \\n\\nExternal rating lower than BBB- or comparable   \\n\\n1,363   \\n\\n153   \\n\\n60   \\n\\n994   \\n\\n302   \\n\\n521   \\n\\nTrade accounts receivable before loss \\nallowances \\n\\n1,575   \\n\\n1,817   \\n\\n648   \\n\\n17   \\n\\n4   \\n\\n669   \\n\\n7   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n7 \\n\\nDecember 31, 2021 \\n\\n€ million \\n\\nLife Science   \\n\\nHealthcare   \\n\\nElectronics   \\n\\nOther \\n\\nExternal rating of at least A- or comparable \\n\\nExternal rating of at least BBB- or comparable \\n\\nExternal rating lower than BBB- or comparable   \\n\\n1,164   \\n\\n150   \\n\\n45   \\n\\n882   \\n\\n285   \\n\\n427   \\n\\nTrade accounts receivable before loss \\nallowances \\n\\n1,359   \\n\\n1,594   \\n\\n598   \\n\\n17   \\n\\n2   \\n\\n617   \\n\\n6   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n–   \\n\\n6 \\n\\n3,012 \\n\\n471 \\n\\n585 \\n\\n4,069 \\n\\nGroup \\n\\n2,651 \\n\\n452 \\n\\n473 \\n\\n3,576 \\n\\nGoods were generally sold under retention of title so that a reimbursement claim existed in the event of default. \\nOther guarantees generally were not demanded.

Statements ___ Capital Structure, Investments, and Financing Activities \\n\\n329 \\n\\nCounterparty credit risk was taken into consideration for measurements of financial instruments at fair value. In \\nthe case of non-derivative financial instruments, such as other liabilities or interest-bearing securities, this was \\nreflected using risk premiums on the discount rate, while discounts on market value (credit valuation \\nadjustments and debit valuation adjustments) were used for derivatives. Transfers between the individual \\nhierarchy levels at fair value are made at the end of the month in which the triggering event – for example an \\ninitial public offering – took place. \\n\\nEquity investments in unlisted companies (Level 3) \\n\\nThe planning periods used to determine the fair value of equity investments in unlisted companies ranged from \\nfour to seven years (December 31, 2021: three to eight years). Cash flows for periods in excess of this are \\nincluded in the terminal value calculation using long-term growth rates of between 1.0% and 9.0% \\n(December 31, 2021: 1.0% and 9.0%). The applied average cost of capital (after tax) was 7.0% on \\nDecember 31, 2022 (December 31, 2021: 7.0%). \\n\\nAssets from contingent considerations (Level 3) \\n\\nThe fair values of assets from contingent considerations are calculated by weighting the expected future \\nmilestone payments and royalties using their probability of occurrence and discounting them. The main \\nparameters when determining contingent considerations are: \\n\\n• \\n\\nthe estimated probability of reaching the individual milestone events, \\n\\n• \\n\\nthe underlying sales planning used to derive royalties, and \\n\\n• \\n\\nthe discount factor used. \\n\\nWhen determining the probability of occurrence of the individual milestones events in connection with the \\ndevelopment of drug candidates, the focus is on empirically available probabilities of success of development \\nprograms in comparable phases of clinical development in the relevant therapeutic areas. To determine the \\nsales plan, internal sales plans and sales plans of external industry services are used. The discount rate (after \\ntax) of between 6.3% and 7.3% as of December 31, 2022 (December 31, 2021: 5.4% to 6.5%) was calculated \\n\\nusing the weighted average cost of capital. \\n\\n Significant discretionary decisions and sources of estimation uncertainty   \\n\\nEquity investments in unlisted companies \\n\\nDetermining the parameters that are to be included in discounted cash-flow-methods and deriving the fair value \\nfrom observable prices within the scope of equity refinancing are both subject to discretionary decisions and \\nestimation uncertainty. \\n\\nAssets from contingent consideration \\n\\nThe calculation of the fair value of assets from contingent considerations is subject to significant discretionary \\njudgment. \\n\\nThe most significant contingent consideration was the future purchase price claim from the disposal of the \\nbiosimilars business to a subsidiary of Fresenius SE & Co. KGaA, Bad Homburg vor der Höhe, Germany, on \\nAugust 31, 2017. It was calculated by an external valuation expert on initial recognition in 2017 and continued \\non this basis. As of December 31, 2022, the carrying amount was € 219 million (December 31, 2021: \\n€ 206 million). \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cConsolidated Financial Statements ___ Notes to the Consolidated

In addition, we have audited the combined management report of MERCK \\nKommanditgesellschaft auf Aktien inclusive of the remuneration report contained in a separate section in the \\ncombined management report, including the related disclosures for the financial year from January 1, 2022, to \\nDecember 31, 2022. In accordance with German legal requirements, we have not audited the components of \\nthe combined management report specified in the “Other Information” section of our auditor’s report. \\n\\nIn our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained in the audit, \\n\\n• \\n\\n• \\n\\nthe accompanying consolidated financial statements comply, in all material respects, with the IFRSs as \\nadopted by the EU, and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to Section 315e (1) \\nHGB [Handelsgesetzbuch: German Commercial Code] and, in compliance with these requirements, give a \\ntrue and fair view of the assets, liabilities, and financial position of the Group as of December 31, 2022, and \\nof its financial performance for the financial year from January 1, 2022, to December 31, 2022, and  \\n\\nthe accompanying combined management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group’s \\nposition. In all material respects, this combined management report is consistent with the consolidated \\nfinancial statements, complies with German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities \\nand risks of future development. Our opinion on the combined management report does not cover the \\ncontent of those components of the combined management report specified in the “Other Information” \\nsection of the auditor’s report. \\n\\nPursuant to Section 322 (3) sentence 1 HGB, we declare that our audit has not led to any reservations relating \\nto the legal compliance of the consolidated financial statements and of the combined management report. \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cIndependent Auditor\\'s Report \\n\\n352 \\n\\nBasis for the Opinions \\n\\nWe conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the combined management report in \\naccordance with Section 317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation No 537/2014 (referred to subsequently as “EU \\nAudit Regulation”) and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits \\npromulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer [Institute of Public Auditors in Germany] (IDW). Our \\nresponsibilities under those requirements and principles are further described in the “Auditor’s Responsibilities \\nfor the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Combined Management Report” section of our \\nauditor’s report. We are independent of the group entities in accordance with the requirements of European law \\nand German commercial and professional law, and we have fulfilled our other German professional \\nresponsibilities in accordance with these requirements. In addition, in accordance with Article 10 (2)(f) of the \\nEU Audit Regulation, we declare that we have not provided non-audit services prohibited under Article 5 (1) of \\nthe EU Audit Regulation. We believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide \\na basis for our opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the combined management report. \\n\\nKey Audit Matters in the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements \\n\\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit \\nof the consolidated financial statements for the financial year from January 1, 2022, to December 31, 2022. \\nThese matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, \\nand in forming our opinion thereon, we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. \\n\\nImpairment testing of goodwill of the operating segment Electronics \\n\\nExplanatory notes on the impairment tests can be found in the notes to the consolidated financial statements \\nunder note 18. \\n\\nThe financial statement risk \\n\\nThe goodwill in the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2022 amounts to EUR 18,415 million \\n(37.9% of the Group’s total assets), with EUR 4,675 million of this attributable to Electronics.  \\n\\nGoodwill on the level of the operating segments is to be tested for impairment once a year and may need be \\ntested ad hoc if necessary. For the goodwill impairment test, the carrying amount is compared with the \\nrecoverable amount of the respective operating segment. The impairment test was carried out as at  \\n31 August 2022. In performing the goodwill impairment test, Merck primarily determines the recoverable \\namount by means of the discounted cash flow method. The valuation model used to determine the recoverable \\namount is complex and the result of this valuation are highly dependent on the projection of future net cash \\nflows (taking into account future revenue growth, profit margins and long-term growth rates) and the discount \\nfactor used, and therefore is subject to significant estimation uncertainty. Based on the impairment test \\nconducted, Merck did not identify any need to recognize an impairment loss. \\n\\nThere is a risk for the financial statements that an existing goodwill impairment loss was not recognized. In \\naddition, there is a risk that the related disclosures in the notes to the consolidated financial statements are not \\ncomplete and appropriate. \\n\\nOur audit approach \\n\\nUsing our own sensitivity analyses, we assessed with the involvement of our own specialists in valuation the \\nextent to which the goodwill of the cash-generating unit Electronics would still be sufficiently covered by the \\nrecoverable amount if assumptions and parameters underlying the calculations were to change in a manner \\nthat is deemed possible. \\n\\nWe reconciled the expected net cash flows underlying the recoverable amount calculation with the current \\nmedium-term plan approved by management. To assess the assumptions used in preparing the medium-term \\n\\n \\n \\n\\x0cIndependent Auditor\\'s Report \\n\\n353 \\n\\nplan, we obtained an understanding of the planning process through discussions with company representatives, \\nincluding corporate management and representatives from the corporate divisions, we assessed the plausibility \\nand consistency of the explanations received with the projections, and we compared the assumptions used with \\nthe expectations of external analysts and sources. \\n\\nAs part of our audit of the discount factor, we analyzed the peer group used. With regard to other assumptions \\nand parameters (e.g. risk-free interest rate, beta factor, market risk premium), we compared those \\nassumptions and parameters with our own assumptions and publicly available data to assess whether these \\nwere appropriate and whether they were within the range of external recommendations, to the extent available. \\nIn addition, we verified the calculation model used to determine the discount factor and qualified the method by \\nusing our own calculation model. We also examined the accuracy of the Company’s previous forecasts by \\ncomparing the budgets of previous financial years with actual earnings and by analyzing deviations.  \\n\\nWe assessed the appropriateness of the valuation model used. In order to assess the methodologically and \\nmathematically appropriate implementation of the valuation method, we have traced the valuation carried out \\nby the company on the basis of our own calculations and analyzed deviations. To verify arithmetical accuracy, \\nwe used a risk-based audit approach to recalculate the Company’s calculations based on samples contained in \\nthe valuation model. \\n\\nIn addition, we assessed whether the Company’s disclosures regarding the goodwill impairment test in the \\nnotes to the consolidated financial statements are complete and appropriate. \\n\\nOur observations \\n\\nThe calculation method used for the goodwill impairment test is appropriate and in line with the applicable \\nvaluation principles. Overall, the assumptions and parameters used by management lead to an appropriate \\nassessment of the recoverability of the goodwill. The disclosures in the notes to the consolidated financial \\nstatements are complete and properly depict the judgment associated with the subsequent measurement of \\ngoodwill. \\n\\nCompleteness and measurement of income tax liabilities \\n\\nExplanatory notes on the completeness and measurement of income tax liabilities can be found in the notes to \\nthe consolidated financial statements under note 15. \\n\\nThe financial statement risk \\n\\nAs of December 31, 2022, income tax liabilities including liabilities for uncertain tax obligations amount to  \\nEUR 1,522 million. \\n\\nMerck operates in different jurisdictions with different legal systems. The application of local regulations on \\nincome tax, tax incentives and transfer pricing rules is complex. The recognition and measurement of income \\ntax liabilities require Merck to exercise judgment in assessing tax matters and to make estimates regarding \\nuncertain tax positions. \\n\\nThe measurement of income tax liabilities is subject to judgment and estimation uncertainty. Merck engages \\nevent driven external experts to support its own risk assessment with expert opinions from tax specialists. \\n\\nThere is a risk for the financial statements that income tax liabilities are not fully recognized or not \\nappropriately measured. \\n\\nOur audit approach \\n\\nWe involved our own tax specialists in national and international tax law into the audit team in order to \\nevaluate Merck’s assessment of tax risks and as far as obtained the related opinions of external experts \\nengaged by Merck. \\n\\n \\n \\n\\x0cIndependent Auditor\\'s Report \\n\\n354 \\n\\nWe obtained an understanding of existing tax risks through inquiry of employees of the tax department. We \\nassessed the competence, capabilities and objectivity of the external experts and evaluated their expert \\nopinions. \\n\\nIn addition, we analyzed correspondence with the relevant tax authorities and assessed the assumptions \\nunderlying the determination of income tax liabilities based on our knowledge and experience of how the \\nrelevant legal requirements are currently applied by the tax authorities and courts. We used a risk-based audit \\napproach to audit the accuracy of the calculation of the income tax liabilities. \\n\\nOur observations \\n\\nThe valuation model and assumptions underlying the completeness and measurement of income tax liabilities \\nare reasonable. \\n\\nOther Information \\n\\nManagement and the Supervisory Board are responsible for the other information. The other information \\ncomprises the following components of the combined management report, whose content was not audited: \\n\\n• \\n\\nthe components of the combined non-financial statement included in a separate section in in the combined \\nmanagement report, \\n\\n• \\n\\nthe corporate governance statement referred to in the combined management report, \\n\\n• \\n\\ninformation extraneous to combined management reports and marked as unaudited and \\n\\n• \\n\\nthe remaining parts of the annual report. \\n\\nThe other information does not comprise the consolidated financial statements, the audited parts of the \\ncombined management report and our auditor’s report. \\n\\nOur opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the combined management report do not cover \\nthe other information, and consequently we do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance \\nconclusion thereon.  \\n\\nIn connection with our audit, our responsibility is to read the other information referred to above and, in so \\ndoing, to consider whether the other information \\n\\n• \\n\\nis materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements, with the information in the combined \\nmanagement report audited for content or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or  \\n\\n•  otherwise appears to be materially misstated.  \\n\\nIn accordance with our engagement, we performed a separate review of the combined non-financial statement. \\nFor the type, scope and results of this review, please refer to our audit report dated, February 16, 2023. \\n\\nResponsibilities of Management and the Supervisory Board for the \\n\\nConsolidated Financial Statements and the Combined Management Report \\n\\nManagement is responsible for the preparation of consolidated financial statements that comply, in all material \\nrespects, with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, and the additional requirements of German commercial law \\npursuant to Section 315e (1) HGB and that the consolidated financial statements, in compliance with these \\nrequirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position, and financial performance of \\nthe Group. In addition, management is responsible for such internal control as they have determined necessary \\nto enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, \\nwhether due to fraud (i.e., fraudulent financial reporting and misappropriation of assets) or error. \\n\\n \\n \\n\\x0cIndependent Auditor\\'s Report \\n\\n355 \\n\\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability \\nto continue as a going concern. They also have the responsibility for disclosing, as applicable, matters related \\nto going concern. In addition, they are responsible for financial reporting based on the going concern basis of \\naccounting unless there is an intention to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or there is no realistic \\nalternative but to do so. \\n\\nFurthermore, management is responsible for the preparation of the combined management report that, as a \\nwhole, provides an appropriate view of the Group’s position and is, in all material respects, consistent with the \\nconsolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements, and appropriately presents the \\nopportunities and risks of future development. In addition, management is responsible for such arrangements \\nand measures (systems) as they have considered necessary to enable the preparation of a combined \\nmanagement report that is in accordance with the applicable German legal requirements, and to be able to \\nprovide sufficient appropriate evidence for the assertions in the combined management report. \\n\\nThe supervisory board is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process for the preparation \\nof the consolidated financial statements and of the combined management report. \\n\\nFurthermore, the management and the Supervisory Board are responsible for the preparation of the \\nremuneration report contained in a separate section of the combined management report, including the related \\ndisclosures, in accordance with the requirements of Section 162 AktG. They are also responsible for such \\ninternal control as they have determined necessary to enable the preparation of the remuneration report that is \\nfree from material misstatement, whether due to fraud (i.e., fraudulent financial reporting and misappropriation \\nof assets) or error. \\n\\nAuditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial \\n\\nStatements and of the Combined Management Report \\n\\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a \\nwhole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and whether the combined \\nmanagement report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group’s position and, in all material \\nrespects, is consistent with the consolidated financial statements and the knowledge obtained in the audit, \\ncomplies with the German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future \\ndevelopment, as well as to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinions on the consolidated financial \\nstatements and on the combined management report.  \\n\\nReasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance \\nwith Section 317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation and in compliance with German Generally Accepted \\nStandards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (IDW) will always \\ndetect a material misstatement. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, \\nindividually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users \\ntaken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements and this combined management report. \\n\\nWe exercise professional judgement and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: \\n\\n• \\n\\nIdentify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements and of the \\ncombined management report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures \\nresponsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for \\nour opinions. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than the risk \\nof not detecting a material misstatement resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, \\nintentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls. \\n\\n•  Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit of the consolidated financial statements \\n\\nand of arrangements and measures (systems) relevant to the audit of the combined management report in \\norder to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of \\nexpressing an opinion on the effectiveness of these systems. \\n\\n \\n \\n\\x0cIndependent Auditor\\'s Report \\n\\n356 \\n\\n•  Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by management and the reasonableness of \\n\\nestimates made by management and related disclosures. \\n\\n•  Conclude on the appropriateness of management\\'s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based \\non the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that \\nmay cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a \\nmaterial uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in the auditor’s report to the related \\ndisclosures in the consolidated financial statements and in the combined management report or, if such \\ndisclosures are inadequate, to modify our respective opinions. Our conclusions are based on the audit \\nevidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause \\nthe Group to cease to be able to continue as a going concern. \\n\\n•  Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including \\nthe disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements present the underlying transactions and \\nevents in a manner that the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets, \\nliabilities, financial position and financial performance of the Group in compliance with IFRSs as adopted by \\nthe EU and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to Section 315e (1) HGB. \\n\\n•  Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business \\n\\nactivities within the Group to express opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the combined \\nmanagement report. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. \\nWe remain solely responsible for our opinions. \\n\\n•  Evaluate the consistency of the combined management report with the consolidated financial statements, its \\n\\nconformity with [German] law, and the view of the Group’s position it provides. \\n\\n•  Perform audit procedures on the prospective information presented by management in the combined \\n\\nmanagement report. On the basis of sufficient appropriate audit evidence we evaluate, in particular, the \\nsignificant assumptions used by management as a basis for the prospective information, and evaluate the \\nproper derivation of the prospective information from these assumptions. We do not express a separate \\nopinion on the prospective information and on the assumptions used as a basis. There is a substantial \\nunavoidable risk that future events will differ materially from the prospective information. \\n\\nWe communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and \\ntiming of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we \\nidentify during our audit. \\n\\nWe also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with the relevant \\nindependence requirements, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may \\nreasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, the actions taken or safeguards \\napplied to eliminate independence threats. \\n\\nFrom the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of \\nmost significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore \\nthe key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes \\npublic disclosure about the matter. \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cIndependent Auditor\\'s Report \\n\\n357 \\n\\nOther Legal and Regulatory Requirements \\n\\nReport on the Assurance on the Electronic Rendering of the Consolidated \\nFinancial Statements and the Combined Management Report Prepared for \\nPublication Purposes in Accordance with Section 317 (3a) HGB \\n\\nWe have performed assurance work in accordance with Section 317 (3a) HGB to obtain reasonable assurance \\nabout whether the rendering of the consolidated financial statements and the combined management report \\n(hereinafter the “ESEF documents”) contained in the electronic file “merckkgaa-2022-12-31-de.zip” (SHA256-\\nHashwert: dc6f940d59fe27ed23869f2f0dba7b17db6e7f5f1fb360d68b42064c5f23a4ee) made available and \\nprepared for publication purposes complies in all material respects with the requirements of Section 328 (1) \\nHGB for the electronic reporting format (“ESEF format”).

Furthermore, the legal representatives are \\nresponsible for the internal controls they deem necessary for the preparation of the combined non-financial \\nstatement that is free of intended or unintended material misstatements. \\n\\nThe EU Taxonomy Regulation and the supplementing Delegated Acts contain wordings and terms that are still \\nsubject to substantial uncertainties regarding their interpretation and for which not all clarifications have been \\npublished yet. Therefore, the legal representatives have included a description of their interpretation in Section \\n“Reporting in accordance with the EU Taxonomy Regulation” of the combined non-financial statement. They are \\nresponsible for its tenability. Due to the innate risk of diverging interpretations of vague legal concepts, the \\nlegal conformity of these interpretations is subject to uncertainty \\n\\nIndependence and Quality Assurance on the Part of the Auditing Firm \\n\\nIn performing this engagement, we applied the legal provisions and professional pronouncements regarding \\nindependence and quality assurance, in particular the Professional Code for German Public Auditors and \\nChartered Accountants (in Germany) and the quality assurance standard of the German Institute of Public \\nAuditors (Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer, IDW) regarding quality assurance requirements in audit practice (IDW \\nQS 1). \\n\\n1 Our engagement applied to the German version of the combined non-financial statement 2022. This text is a translation of the Independent Assurance \\nReport issued in German, whereas the German text is authoritative. \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cIndependent Auditor\\'s Report \\n\\n360 \\n\\nPractitioner’s Responsibility \\n\\nIt is our responsibility to express a conclusion on the combined non-financial statement based on our work \\nperformed within a limited assurance engagement. \\n\\nWe conducted our work in the form of a limited assurance engagement in accordance with the International \\nStandard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 (Revised): “Assurance Engagements other than Audits or \\nReviews of Historical Financial Information”, published by IAASB. Accordingly, we have to plan and perform the \\nassurance engagement in such a way that we obtain limited assurance as to whether any matters have come to \\nour attention that cause us to believe that the combined non-financial statement of the Company for the period \\nfrom January 1 to December 31, 2022, has not been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with \\n§§ 315b and 315c in conjunction with 289b to 289e HGB and with the EU Taxonomy Regulation and the \\nsupplementing Delegated Acts as well as the interpretation of the wordings and terms contained in the EU \\nTaxonomy Regulation and in the supplementing Delegated Acts by the legal representatives as disclosed in \\nSection “Reporting in accordance with the EU Taxonomy Regulation” of the combined non-financial statement. \\n\\nWe do not, however, issue a separate conclusion for each disclosure. As the assurance procedures performed in \\na limited assurance engagement are less comprehensive than in a reasonable assurance engagement, the level \\nof assurance obtained is substantially lower. The choice of assurance procedures is subject to the auditor’s own \\njudgement. \\n\\nWithin the scope of our engagement, we performed, amongst others, the following procedures: \\n\\n• \\n\\nInquiries of group-level personnel who are responsible for the materiality analysis in order to understand the \\nprocesses for determining material topics and respective reporting boundaries for Merck KGaA \\n\\n•  A risk analysis, including media research, to identify relevant information on Merck KGaA’s sustainability \\n\\nperformance in the reporting period \\n\\n•  Evaluation of the design and the implementation of systems and processes for the collection, processing and \\nmonitoring of disclosures, including data consolidation, on environmental, employee and social matters, \\nrespect for human rights, and combating corruption and bribery matters \\n\\n• \\n\\nInquiries of group-level personnel who are responsible for determining disclosures on concepts, due \\ndiligence processes, results and risks, performing internal control functions and consolidating disclosures \\n\\n• \\n\\nInspection of selected internal and external documents \\n\\n•  Analytical evaluation of data and of the trends of quantitative disclosures as reported at group level by all sites  \\n\\n•  Evaluation of local data collection, validation and reporting processes as well as of the reliability of reported \\n\\ndata based on a sample of the sites in Nanke in Taiwan, Milwaukee & Sheboygan in USA and in Darmstadt in \\nGermany in the form of virtual meetings  \\n\\n• \\n\\nInquiries of responsible employees at Group level to obtain an understanding of the approach to identify \\nrelevant economic activities in accordance with EU Taxonomy \\n\\n•  Evaluation of the design and the implementation of systems and processes for the collection, processing and \\nmonitoring of disclosures on turnover, capital expenditures and operating expenditures for the taxonomy-\\nrelevant economic activities for the environmental objectives of climate change mitigation and adaptation \\n\\n•  Assessment of data collection, validation and reporting processes and reliability of reported data for the \\ntaxonomy-aligned economic activities in relation to the assurance on the Technical Screening Criteria \\n(substantial contribution for the environmental objective, DNSH criteria) and minimum safeguards \\n\\n•  Assessment of the overall presentation of the disclosures \\n\\n \\n \\n\\x0cIndependent Auditor\\'s Report \\n\\n361 \\n\\nThe legal representatives have to interpret vague legal concepts in order to be able to compile the relevant \\ndisclosures according to Article 8 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation. Due to the innate risk of diverging \\ninterpretations of vague legal concepts, the legal conformity of these interpretations and, correspondingly, our \\nassurance thereof are subject to uncertainty. \\n\\nIn our opinion, we obtained sufficient and appropriate evidence for reaching a conclusion for the assurance \\nengagement. \\n\\nConclusion \\n\\nBased on the procedures performed and the evidence obtained, nothing has come to our attention that causes \\nus to believe that the combined non-financial statement of Merck KGaA for the period from January 1 to \\nDecember 31, 2022 has not been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with §§ 315b and 315c in \\nconjunction with 289b to 289e HGB and with the EU Taxonomy Regulation and the supplementing Delegated \\nActs as well as the interpretation disclosed in Section “Reporting in accordance with the EU Taxonomy \\nRegulation” of the combined non-financial statement.  \\n\\nRestriction of Use/General Engagement Terms \\n\\nThis assurance report is issued for purposes of the Supervisory Board of Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, only.

We made progress in\\ntwo significant undertakings: preparing Johnson & \\nJohnson to operate as a faster, more focused two-\\nsector company, and initiating the separation of our\\nConsumer Health business, Kenvue. We did all of this \\nin a year when every industry felt the effects of high\\ninflation, geopolitical tension, and continued supply\\nchain disruption.\\n\\nTimes like these remind me how privileged I am to\\nlead Johnson & Johnson as the eighth Chairman \\nand CEO in our history. Our company has navigated \\nthrough many economic cycles while addressing \\nhealthcare’s most important unmet needs for 137 \\nyears. Over that time, we have learned how to make\\ndecisions for the long-term.\\n\\nOur deep commitment to Our Credo values,\\nand determination to use our size for good, have\\nlong made us a global leader in health. Focusing on \\npatient and customer needs reinforces our sense\\nof purpose and urgency. Thanks to the 150,000 \\nemployees who embody these ideals—and the \\nbreadth and diversification of our business—2022\\nwas a successful year.\\n\\nPerformance and Priorities\\n\\nIn 2022, we achieved full-year operational sales\\ngrowth of more than 6%*. Adjusted net earnings\\nwere $27 billion* and adjusted diluted net earnings\\nper share were $10.15*, representing increases of \\n3.2% and 3.6% respectively, compared to 2021. On\\nan operational basis, adjusted diluted net earnings per\\nshare increased by 9.2%*.\\n\\nWe invested nearly $15 billion in R&D, deployed\\nmore than $17 billion toward acquisitions, increased\\nour dividend for the 60th consecutive year, and\\nreturned capital to shareholders through our share \\nrepurchase program.\\n\\nJoaquin Duato\\nChairman and CEO\\n\\nOur total shareholder return (TSR) for 2022\\noutperformed both our Competitor Composite \\nand the S&P 500, contributing to our TSR of nearly\\n13% compounded annual growth rate over the last \\nten years. This significant value creation was made \\npossible by both our long-term strategic focus\\nand outstanding execution from teams in all three \\nsegments of our business.\\n\\nMEDTECH\\n\\nWe performed in line or ahead of our competitive \\ncomposite for the past two years. Growth was driven\\nby our focused commercial strategies, the successful \\nlaunch of differentiated products, and improvements in \\nglobal procedure recovery.\\n\\n•   We delivered on our innovation agenda by\\n\\naccelerating the cadence of new products and\\nsignificantly enhancing our MedTech pipeline, which \\nincluded more than 20 programs with over $100\\nmillion of net present value potential in 2022.\\n\\n•   MedTech delivered operational sales growth* across\\n\\nall businesses in 2022: Orthopaedics, Surgery,\\nInterventional Solutions, and Vision.\\n\\n•   The acquisition of Abiomed positions us as the global\\nleader in heart recovery, immediately enhances our\\nMedTech revenue growth, and further diversifies our\\nportfolio (which now includes 12 priority platforms with\\nover $1 billion in annual revenue).\\n\\nChairman’s Letter\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\x0cPHARMACEUTICAL\\n\\nWe strengthened our position as a leading\\npharmaceutical company by delivering our 11th \\nconsecutive year of above-market adjusted \\noperational sales growth, excluding our\\nCOVID-19 vaccine.\\n\\n•   Our growth was driven by several of our oncology \\nand immunology medicines, including DARZALEX,\\nERLEADA, STELARA, and TREMFYA.\\n\\n•   We continue to investigate new indications and \\ntransformative regimens to reach even more\\npatients, including DARZALEX in front-line multiple\\nmyeloma, ERLEADA in early-stage prostate cancer,\\nTREMFYA in Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, and\\nRYBREVANT in combination with lazertinib in front-line,\\nnon-small-cell lung cancer with EGFR mutations.\\n\\n•   Investment in our pipeline further strengthened our\\nportfolio of multiple myeloma medicines. In addition\\nto the launches of CARVYKTI, our first cell therapy, \\nand TECVAYLI, a first-in-class bispecific antibody, we\\nsubmitted a BLA for talquetamab, an investigational, \\noff-the-shelf bispecific antibody.\\n\\nCONSUMER HEALTH\\n\\nWe made significant strides toward the separation of\\nthe business into an independent company while also \\ndelivering solid performance for the year.\\n\\n•   We rolled out the Kenvue name and brand, reflective of \\nboth Johnson & Johnson’s storied history and Kenvue’s \\nbright future as a standalone organization. \\n\\n•   We appointed leadership, including Thibaut Mongon as\\nCEO Designate, Paul Ruh as CFO Designate, and Larry\\nMerlo, former Chairman and CEO of CVS, as Non-\\nExecutive Chair Designate of Kenvue.\\n\\n•   Starting in 2023, we began operating our consumer \\n\\nbusiness as a company within a company. Earlier this \\nyear, Kenvue filed a Form S-1 with the SEC, giving us \\nthe option to pursue an IPO as a potential step in the\\nseparation, and we remain on track to complete the \\nprocess during 2023.\\n\\nWe know that to have the greatest impact on patients, \\nwe must continue prioritizing the most promising\\nopportunities. Our ongoing emphasis on building\\ndigital capabilities, including AI, data science, and \\nintelligent automation, will fuel the next wave of \\ninnovation at the intersection of science and technology.\\n\\n2\\n\\nChairman’s Letter\\n\\nDelivering for the world\\n\\n$52 million \\n\\ncommitted to programs\\nfocused on closing\\nthe racial health gap\\nas part of Our Race to\\nHealth Equity initiative,\\nwith investments in\\ncommunity health\\ncenters, health\\nliteracy education,\\nand increasing racial\\ndiversity in the\\nhealthcare talent\\npipeline and workforce\\n\\n10 African\\ncountries\\nwhere a $15 million\\ncommitment from the\\nJohnson & Johnson\\nFoundation to the Africa\\nFrontline First Catalytic\\nFund is providing\\nsupport to community \\nhealth workers\\n\\n2.2 billion\\n\\ndoses of VERMOX\\ndonated since 2006 to\\nfacilitate treatment of\\nintestinal worms\\n\\n#2 rank\\n\\nin the Access to\\nMedicine Index,\\nreflecting our decades-\\nlong strategy to\\nmaximize access to our\\ninnovative medicines\\nand technologies\\n\\n$5+ billion\\n\\nglobal impact spend \\nwith small and \\ndiverse suppliers\\n\\n5 consecutive\\nyears \\nof recognition with\\na CDP A-List rating \\nfor our leadership in \\nclimate action\\n\\n12 weeks\\n\\nof paid parental leave\\nfor qualified Johnson \\n& Johnson employees\\naround the world\\n\\n100%\\nrenewable\\nelectricity\\nsecured for our\\noperations in Brazil\\nthrough a Direct\\nPower Purchase\\nAgreement \\nstarting in 2023\\n\\n\\x0cDelivering for investors\\n\\n60 straight years\\n\\nof increased dividends\\n\\n3 number of \\ncompanies\\nin the world with a AAA \\ncredit rating, including\\nJohnson & Johnson\\n\\n$14.6 billion\\n\\ninvested in R&D\\n\\n$17.7 billion\\n\\ninvested in mergers \\nand acquisitions\\n\\n29\\n\\nbrands and platforms \\nwith more than $1 billion \\nin sales in 2022\\n\\n#1 rank\\n\\non Fortune’s Most Admired\\nCompanies list for the \\nPharmaceutical industry\\n\\n~65%\\n\\nof 10-year free cash flow* \\nreturned to shareholders\\n\\n* Cash flow from operating activities less\\nadditions to property plant and equipment\\n\\nThe Opportunity and Responsibility to Lead\\n\\nAs I met with customers, partners, government officials,\\nand employees around the world during my first year \\nas CEO, I was constantly reminded of what the world \\nexpects from us.

This \\naffirms our purpose and motivates us every day. \\n\\nThese standards were set in no small part by my \\npredecessor, Alex Gorsky. I am deeply honored to \\nserve as Chairman and CEO following his retirement.\\nAlex laid a strong foundation for the future, anchored in\\nthe people of Johnson & Johnson. They have always\\nbeen our greatest strength, and their commitment to\\nOur Credo fills me with confidence and inspiration\\nevery day. \\n\\n2023 will be one of the most important years in our\\nhistory—a new chapter not just for one, but two leading\\nglobal companies. Johnson & Johnson is uniquely \\npositioned to lead our industry through a fast-moving \\nhealthcare landscape.\\n\\nAs the world evolves, Johnson & Johnson will evolve\\nahead of it. We know we can do this because we’ve\\ndone it so many times before.

Management and representatives of Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company) also may from time to\\ntime make forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements do not relate strictly to historical or current facts and\\nreflect management’s assumptions, views, plans, objectives and projections about the future. Forward-looking statements\\nmay be identified by the use of words such as “plans,” “expects,” “will,” “anticipates,” “estimates” and other words of\\nsimilar meaning in conjunction with, among other things: discussions of future operations; expected operating results and\\nfinancial performance; impact of planned acquisitions and dispositions; impact and timing of restructuring initiatives,\\nincluding associated cost savings and other benefits; the planned separation of the Company’s Consumer Health\\nbusiness; the Company’s strategy for growth; product development activities; regulatory approvals; market position and\\nexpenditures.\\n\\nBecause forward-looking statements are based on current beliefs, expectations and assumptions regarding future events,\\nthey are subject to uncertainties, risks and changes that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of the\\nCompany’s control. Investors should realize that if underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, or known or unknown risks or\\nuncertainties materialize, the Company’s actual results and financial condition could vary materially from expectations and\\nprojections expressed or implied in its forward-looking statements. Investors are therefore cautioned not to rely on these\\nforward-looking statements. Risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to:\\n\\nRisks Related to Product Development, Market Success and Competition\\n\\n• Challenges and uncertainties inherent in innovation and development of new and improved products and technologies\\non which the Company’s continued growth and success depend, including uncertainty of clinical outcomes, additional\\nanalysis of existing clinical data, obtaining regulatory approvals, health plan coverage and customer access, and initial\\nand continued commercial success;\\n\\n• Challenges to the Company’s ability to obtain and protect adequate patent and other intellectual property rights for new\\n\\nand existing products and technologies in the United States and other important markets;\\n\\n• The impact of patent expirations, typically followed by the introduction of competing generic, biosimilar or other products\\n\\nand resulting revenue and market share losses;\\n\\n• Increasingly aggressive and frequent challenges to the Company’s patents by competitors and others seeking to launch\\n\\ncompeting generic, biosimilar or other products and increased receptivity of courts, the United States Patent and\\nTrademark Office and other decision makers to such challenges, potentially resulting in loss of market exclusivity and\\nrapid decline in sales for the relevant product sooner than expected;\\n\\n• Competition in research and development of new and improved products, processes and technologies, which can result\\n\\nin product and process obsolescence;\\n\\n• Competition to reach agreement with third parties for collaboration, licensing, development and marketing agreements\\n\\nfor products and technologies;\\n\\n• Competition based on cost-effectiveness, product performance, technological advances and patents attained by\\n\\ncompetitors;

licensing and patent rights; sales and promotion of healthcare products; access\\nto, and reimbursement and pricing for, healthcare products and services; environmental protection; and sourcing of raw\\nmaterials;\\n\\n• Compliance with local regulations and laws that may restrict the Company’s ability to manufacture or sell its products in\\nrelevant markets, including requirements to comply with medical device reporting regulations and other requirements\\nsuch as the European Union’s Medical Devices Regulation;\\n\\n• Changes in domestic and international tax laws and regulations, increasing audit scrutiny by tax authorities around the\\n\\nworld and exposures to additional tax liabilities potentially in excess of existing reserves; and\\n\\n• The issuance of new or revised accounting standards by the Financial Accounting Standards Board and regulations by\\n\\nthe Securities and Exchange Commission.\\n\\nRisks Related to the Company’s Strategic Initiatives, Healthcare Market Trends and the Planned\\nSeparation of the Company’s Consumer Health Business\\n\\n• Pricing pressures resulting from trends toward healthcare cost containment, including the continued consolidation\\n\\namong healthcare providers and other market participants, trends toward managed care, the shift toward governments\\nincreasingly becoming the primary payers of healthcare expenses, significant new entrants to the healthcare markets\\nseeking to reduce costs and government pressure on companies to voluntarily reduce costs and price increases;\\n• Restricted spending patterns of individual, institutional and governmental purchasers of healthcare products and\\n\\nservices due to economic hardship and budgetary constraints;\\n\\n• Challenges to the Company’s ability to realize its strategy for growth including through externally sourced innovations,\\nsuch as development collaborations, strategic acquisitions, licensing and marketing agreements, and the potential\\nheightened costs of any such external arrangements due to competitive pressures;\\n\\n• The potential that the expected strategic benefits and opportunities from any planned or completed acquisition or\\n\\ndivestiture by the Company may not be realized or may take longer to realize than expected;\\n\\n• The potential that the expected benefits and opportunities related to past and ongoing restructuring actions may not be\\n\\nrealized or may take longer to realize than expected;\\n\\n• The Company’s ability to consummate the planned separation of the Company’s Consumer Health business on a timely\\n\\nbasis or at all;\\n\\n• The Company’s ability to successfully separate the Company’s Consumer Health business and realize the anticipated\\n\\nbenefits from the planned separation; and\\n\\n• The New Consumer Health Company’s ability to succeed as a standalone publicly traded company.\\n\\nRisks Related to Economic Conditions, Financial Markets and Operating Internationally\\n\\n• The risks associated with global operations on the Company and its customers and suppliers, including foreign\\n\\ngovernments in countries in which the Company operates;\\n\\n• The impact of inflation and fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates and the potential effect of such\\n\\nfluctuations on revenues, expenses and resulting margins;\\n\\n• Potential changes in export/import and trade laws, regulations and policies of the United States and other countries,\\n\\nincluding any increased trade restrictions or tariffs and potential drug reimportation legislation;\\n\\n• The impact on international operations from financial instability in international economies, sovereign risk, possible\\n\\nimposition of governmental controls and restrictive economic policies, and unstable international governments and legal\\nsystems;\\n\\n• The impact of global public health crises and pandemics, including the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic;\\n• Changes to global climate, extreme weather and natural disasters that could affect demand for the Company’s products\\nand services, cause disruptions in manufacturing and distribution networks, alter the availability of goods and services\\nwithin the supply chain, and affect the overall design and integrity of the Company’s products and operations; and\\n\\n• The impact of armed conflicts and terrorist attacks in the United States and other parts of the world, including social and\\n\\neconomic disruptions and instability of financial and other markets.\\n\\n• Johnson & Johnson 2022 Annual Report\\n\\n\\x0cRisks Related to Supply Chain and Operations\\n\\n• Difficulties and delays in manufacturing, internally, through third-party providers or otherwise within the supply chain, that\\n\\nmay lead to voluntary or involuntary business interruptions or shutdowns, product shortages, withdrawals or\\nsuspensions of products from the market, and potential regulatory action;\\n\\n• Interruptions and breaches of the Company’s information technology systems or those of the Company’s vendors,\\nwhich could result in reputational, competitive, operational or other business harm as well as financial costs and\\nregulatory action;\\n\\n• Reliance on global supply chains and production and distribution processes that are complex and subject to increasing\\n\\nregulatory requirements that may adversely affect supply, sourcing and pricing of materials used in the Company’s\\nproducts; and\\n\\n• The potential that the expected benefits and opportunities related to restructuring actions contemplated for the global\\nsupply chain may not be realized or may take longer to realize than expected, including due to any required approvals\\nfrom applicable regulatory authorities.\\n\\nInvestors also should carefully read the Risk Factors described in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a\\ndescription of certain risks that could, among other things, cause the Company’s actual results to differ materially from\\nthose expressed in its forward-looking statements. Investors should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify\\nall such factors and should not consider the risks described above and in Item 1A to be a complete statement of all\\npotential risks and uncertainties.

Johnson & Johnson\\nis a holding company, with operating companies conducting business in virtually all countries of the world. The Company’s\\nprimary focus is products related to human health and well-being. Johnson & Johnson was incorporated in the State of\\nNew Jersey in 1887.\\n\\nThe Executive Committee of Johnson & Johnson is the principal management group responsible for the strategic\\noperations and allocation of the resources of the Company.

These products are distributed to wholesalers, hospitals and retailers, and used predominantly\\nin the professional fields by physicians, nurses, hospitals, eye care professionals and clinics.\\n\\nGeographic Areas\\n\\nJohnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company) have approximately 152,700 employees worldwide engaged in the\\nresearch and development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the healthcare field. The Company\\nconducts business in virtually all countries of the world with the primary focus on products related to human health and\\nwell-being.\\n\\nThe products made and sold in the international business include many of those described above under “– Segments of\\nBusiness – Consumer Health,” “– Pharmaceutical” and “– MedTech.” However, the principal markets, products and\\nmethods of distribution in the international business vary with the country and the culture. The products sold in\\ninternational business include those developed in the U.S. and by subsidiaries abroad.\\n\\n2 • Johnson & Johnson 2022 Annual Report\\n\\n\\x0cInvestments and activities in some countries outside the U.S. are subject to higher risks than comparable U.S. activities\\nbecause the investment and commercial climate may be influenced by financial instability in international economies,\\nrestrictive economic policies and political and legal system uncertainties.\\n\\nRaw Materials\\n\\nRaw materials essential to the Company’s business are generally readily available from multiple sources. Where there are\\nexceptions, the temporary unavailability of those raw materials would not likely have a material adverse effect on the\\nfinancial results of the Company.\\n\\nPatents\\n\\nThe Company’s subsidiaries have made a practice of obtaining patent protection on their products and processes where\\npossible. They own, or are licensed under, a significant number of patents in the U.S. and other countries relating to their\\nproducts, product uses, formulations and manufacturing processes, which in the aggregate are believed to be of material\\nimportance to the Company in the operation of its businesses. The Company’s subsidiaries face patent challenges from\\nthird parties, including challenges seeking to manufacture and market generic and biosimilar versions of the Company’s\\nkey pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products. Significant legal\\nproceedings and claims involving the Company’s patent and other intellectual property are described in Note 19, “Legal\\nProceedings—Intellectual Property” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report.\\n\\nSales of the Company’s largest product, STELARA (ustekinumab), accounted for approximately 10.2% of the Company’s\\ntotal revenues for fiscal 2022. Accordingly, the patents related to this product are believed to be material to the Company.\\nJanssen Biotech, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson, owns patents specifically related to STELARA.\\nThe latest expiring United States composition of matter patent expires in 2023. The latest expiring European composition\\nof matter patent expires in 2024.\\n\\nSales of the Company’s second largest product, collectively DARZALEX (daratumumab) and DARZALEX FASPRO\\n(daratumumab and hyaluronidase-fihj), accounted for approximately 8.4% of the Company’s total revenues for fiscal 2022.\\nAccordingly, the patents related to this product are believed to be material to the Company. Genmab A/S owns two\\npatent families related to DARZALEX, and Janssen Biotech, Inc. has an exclusive license to those patent families. The two\\npatent families both expire in the United States in 2029. The latest expiring licensed European patent expires in 2032.\\nJanssen Biotech, Inc. owns a separate patent portfolio related to DARZALEX FASPRO.\\n\\nTrademarks\\n\\nThe Company’s subsidiaries have made a practice of selling their products under trademarks and of obtaining protection\\nfor these trademarks by all available means. These trademarks are protected by registration in the U.S. and other countries\\nwhere such products are marketed. The Company considers these trademarks in the aggregate to be of material\\nimportance in the operation of its businesses.\\n\\nSeasonality\\n\\nWorldwide sales do not reflect any significant degree of seasonality; however, spending has typically been heavier in the\\nfourth quarter of each year than in other quarters. This reflects increased spending decisions, principally for advertising\\nand research and development activity.\\n\\nCompetition\\n\\nIn all of their product lines, the Company’s subsidiaries compete with companies both locally and globally. Competition\\nexists in all product lines without regard to the number and size of the competing companies involved. Competition in\\nresearch, both internally and externally sourced, involving the development and the improvement of new and existing\\nproducts and processes, is particularly significant. The development of new and innovative products, as well as protecting\\nthe underlying intellectual property of the Company’s product portfolio, is important to the Company’s success in all areas\\nof its business. The competitive environment requires substantial investments in continuing research. In addition, the\\ndevelopment and maintenance of customer demand for the Company’s consumer products involve significant\\nexpenditures for advertising and promotion.\\n\\nJohnson & Johnson 2022 Annual Report • 3\\n\\n\\x0cEnvironment\\n\\nThe Company is subject to a variety of U.S. and international environmental protection measures. The Company believes\\nthat its operations comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations. The Company’s\\ncompliance with these requirements is not expected to have a material effect upon its capital expenditures, cash flows,\\nearnings or competitive position.\\n\\nRegulation\\n\\nThe Company’s businesses are subject to varying degrees of governmental regulation in the countries in which operations\\nare conducted, and the general trend is toward increasingly stringent regulation and enforcement. The Company is subject\\nto costly and complex U.S. and foreign laws and governmental regulations and any adverse regulatory action may\\nmaterially adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and business operations. In the U.S., the drug, device and\\ncosmetic industries have long been subject to regulation by various federal and state agencies, primarily as to product\\nsafety, efficacy, manufacturing, advertising, labeling and safety reporting. The exercise of broad regulatory powers by the\\nU.S. Food and Drug Administration (the U.S. FDA) continues to result in increases in the amounts of testing and\\ndocumentation required for U.S. FDA approval of new drugs and devices and a corresponding increase in the expense of\\nproduct introduction. Similar trends are also evident in major markets outside of the U.S. The new medical device\\nregulatory framework and the evolving privacy, data localization, and emerging cyber security laws and regulations around\\nthe world are examples of such increased regulation. Five U.S. States (California, Connecticut, Colorado, Utah and\\nVirginia) now have comprehensive privacy laws in place and China introduced broad personal information protection and\\ndata security regulations in 2022. With other jurisdictions enacting similar privacy laws, local data protection authorities\\nwill force greater accountability on the collection, access and use of personal data in the healthcare industry.\\n\\nThe regulatory agencies under whose purview the Company operates have administrative powers that may subject it to actions\\nsuch as product withdrawals, recalls, seizure of products and other civil and criminal sanctions. In some cases, the Company’s\\nsubsidiaries may deem it advisable to initiate product recalls regardless of whether it has been required or directed to.\\n\\nThe U.S. FDA and regulatory agencies around the globe are also increasing their enforcement activities. If the U.S. FDA\\nwere to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, or that any of our drugs or medical\\ndevices are ineffective or pose an unreasonable health risk, the U.S. FDA could ban such products, detain or seize\\nadulterated or misbranded products, order a recall, repair, replacement, or refund of such products, refuse to grant\\npending applications for marketing authorization or require certificates of foreign governments for exports, and/or require\\nus to notify health professionals and others that the products present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public\\nhealth. The U.S. FDA may also assess civil or criminal penalties against us, our officers or employees and impose\\noperating restrictions on a company-wide basis, or enjoin and/or restrain certain conduct resulting in violations of\\napplicable law. The U.S. FDA may also recommend prosecution to the U.S. Department of Justice. Any adverse regulatory\\naction, depending on its magnitude, may restrict us from effectively marketing and selling our products and limit our ability\\nto obtain future clearances or approvals, and could result in a substantial modification to our business practices and\\noperations. Equivalent enforcement mechanisms exist in different countries in which we conduct business.\\n\\nThe costs of human healthcare have been and continue to be a subject of study, investigation and regulation by\\ngovernmental agencies and legislative bodies around the world. In the U.S., attention has been focused by states,\\nregulatory agencies and Congress on prices, profits, overutilization and the quality and costs of healthcare generally. Laws\\nand regulations have been enacted to require adherence to strict compliance standards and prevent fraud and abuse in\\nthe healthcare industry. There is increased focus on interactions and financial relationships between healthcare companies\\nand healthcare providers. Various transparency laws and regulations require disclosures of payments and other transfers\\nof value made to physicians and teaching hospitals and, beginning with disclosures in 2022, to certain non-physician\\npractitioners. Federal and foreign laws governing international business practices require strict compliance with anti-\\nbribery standards and certain prohibitions with respect to payments to any foreign government official. Payers and\\nPharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs) have become a more potent force in the market place and increased attention is\\nbeing paid to drug pricing and appropriate drug and medical device utilization.\\n\\nOur business has been and continues to be affected by federal and state legislation that alters the pricing, coverage, and\\nreimbursement landscape. At the federal level, in August 2022, President Biden signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA),\\nwhich includes provisions that effectively authorize the government to establish prices for certain high-spend single-source drugs\\nand biologics reimbursed by the Medicare program, starting in 2026 for Medicare Part D drugs and 2028 for Medicare Part B\\ndrugs. It is not yet certain which products the federal government will select and subject to government-established prices, or how\\nthe federal government will establish prices for selected products, as the IRA specifies a ceiling price but not a minimum price. One\\nor more of our products could be selected and subject to the government-established price.\\n\\n4 • Johnson & Johnson 2022 Annual Report\\n\\n\\x0cThe IRA also contains provisions that impose rebates if certain prices increase at a rate that outpaces the rate of inflation,\\nbeginning October 1, 2022, for Medicare Part D drugs and January 1, 2023, for Medicare Part B drugs. Separate IRA\\nprovisions redesign the Medicare Part D benefit in various ways, including by shifting a greater portion of costs to\\nmanufacturers within certain coverage phases and replacing the Part D coverage gap discount program with a new\\nmanufacturer discounting program. Failure to comply with IRA provisions may subject manufacturers to various penalties,\\nincluding civil monetary penalties. The impact of the IRA on our business and the broader pharmaceutical industry remains\\nuncertain, as the federal government has yet to make various IRA implementation decisions.\\n\\nAdditionally, we expect continued scrutiny on drug pricing and government price reporting from Congress, agencies, and\\nother bodies at the federal and state levels.\\n\\nThere are a number of additional bills pending in Congress and healthcare reform proposals at the state level that would\\naffect drug pricing, including in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. This changing legal landscape has both positive and\\nnegative impacts on the U.S. healthcare industry with much remaining uncertain as to how various provisions of federal\\nand state law, and potential modification or repeal of these laws, will ultimately affect the industry. The IRA and any other\\nfederal or state legislative change could affect the pricing and market conditions for our products.\\n\\nIn addition, business practices in the healthcare industry have come under increased scrutiny, particularly in the U.S., by\\ngovernment agencies and state attorneys general, and resulting investigations and prosecutions carry the risk of significant\\ncivil and criminal penalties. Of note is the increased enforcement activity by data protection authorities in various\\njurisdictions, particularly in the European Union, where significant fines have been levied on companies for data breaches,\\nviolations of privacy requirements, and unlawful cross-border data transfers. In the U.S., the Federal Trade Commission\\nhas stepped up enforcement of data privacy with several significant settlements and there have been a material increase in\\nclass-action lawsuits linked to the collection and use of biometric data.\\n\\nFurther, the Company relies on global supply chains, and production and distribution processes, that are complex, are\\nsubject to increasing regulatory requirements, and may be faced with unexpected changes such as those resulting from\\nthe COVID-19 pandemic and Brexit that may affect sourcing, supply and pricing of materials used in the Company’s\\nproducts. These processes also are subject to complex and lengthy regulatory approvals.\\n\\nEmployees and Human Capital Management\\n\\nAs of January 1, 2023, and January 2, 2022, the number of employees were approximately:\\n\\nEmployees1\\n\\nFull-time equivalent (FTE) positions2\\n\\n2022\\n\\n2021\\n\\n155,800\\n\\n144,300\\n\\n152,700\\n\\n141,700\\n\\n1\\n\\n2\\n\\n“Employee” is defined as an individual working full-time or part-time, excluding fixed term employees, interns and co-op employees.\\nEmployee data may not include full population from more recently acquired companies and individuals on long-term disability are excluded.\\nContingent workers, contractors and subcontractors are also excluded.

Management is responsible for ensuring that its policies and processes reflect and reinforce the Company’s\\ndesired corporate culture, including policies and processes related to strategy, risk management, and ethics and\\ncompliance. The Company’s human capital management strategy is built on three fundamental focus areas:\\n\\n• Attracting and recruiting the best talent\\n\\n• Developing and retaining talent\\n\\n• Empowering and inspiring talent\\n\\nUnderpinning these focus areas are ongoing efforts to cultivate and foster a culture built on diversity, equity and inclusion\\n(DEI), innovation, health, well-being and safety, where the Company’s employees are encouraged to succeed both\\nprofessionally and personally while helping the Company achieve its business goals.\\n\\nCulture and Employee Engagement\\n\\nAt the Company, employees are guided by Our Credo which sets forth the Company’s responsibilities to patients,\\nconsumers, customers, healthcare professionals, employees, communities and shareholders. Employees worldwide must\\nadhere to the Company’s Code of Business Conduct which sets basic requirements and serves as a foundation for the\\nCompany policies, procedures and guidelines, all of which provide additional guidance on expected employee behaviors in\\nevery market where it operates. The Company conducts global surveys that offer its employees the ability to provide\\nfeedback and valuable insight to help address potential human resources risks and identify opportunities to improve. In\\n2022, 92% of global employees across 77 countries participated in Our Credo Survey which was offered in 36\\nlanguages.\\n\\nGrowth and Development\\n\\nTo continue to lead in the changing healthcare landscape, it is crucial that the Company continue to attract and retain top\\ntalent. The Company believes that its employees must be equipped with the right knowledge and skills and be provided\\nwith opportunities to grow and develop in their careers. Accordingly, professional development programs and educational\\nresources are available to all employees. The Company’s objective is to foster a learning culture that helps shape each\\nperson’s unique career path while creating a robust pipeline of talent to deliver on the Company’s long-term strategies. In\\nfurtherance of this objective, the Company deploys a global approach to ensure development is for everyone, regardless of\\nwhere they are on their career journey. In 2022, 46.2% of employees in Manager and above job categories who had\\nmovements (including upward promotions or lateral transfers) took advantage of career opportunities by moving across\\nfunctions, country or business segment lines (excluding employees in the research and development organizations). The\\nCompany’s voluntary turnover rate was 9%.\\n\\nDiversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI)\\n\\nThe Company is committed to workplace diversity and to cultivating, fostering, and advancing a culture of equity and\\ninclusion.

RISK FACTORS\\n\\nAn investment in the Company’s common stock or debt securities involves risks and uncertainties. The Company seeks to\\nidentify, manage and mitigate risks to our business, but uncertainties and risks are difficult to predict and many are outside\\nof the Company’s control and cannot therefore be eliminated. In addition to the other information in this report and the\\nCompany’s other filings with the SEC, investors should consider carefully the factors set forth below. Investors should be\\naware that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors and that the following is not meant to be a complete\\ndiscussion of all potential risks or uncertainties. If known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, the Company’s\\nbusiness, results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected, potentially in a material way.\\n\\nRisks Related to Our Business, Industry and Operations\\n\\nThe Company’s businesses operate in highly competitive product markets and competitive pressures could\\nadversely affect the Company’s earnings.\\n\\nThe Company faces substantial competition in all three operating segments and in all geographic markets. The Company’s\\nbusinesses compete with companies of all sizes on the basis of cost-effectiveness, technological innovations, intellectual\\nproperty rights, product performance, real or perceived product advantages, pricing and availability and rate of\\nreimbursement. The Company also competes with other market participants in securing rights to acquisitions,\\ncollaborations and licensing agreements with third parties. Competition for rights to product candidates and technologies\\nmay result in significant investment and acquisition costs and onerous agreement terms for the Company. Competitors’\\ndevelopment of more effective or less costly products, and/or their ability to secure patent and other intellectual property\\nrights and successfully market products ahead of the Company, could negatively impact sales of the Company’s existing\\nproducts as well as its ability to bring new products to market despite significant prior investment in the related product\\ndevelopment.\\n\\nFor the Company’s Pharmaceutical businesses, loss of patent exclusivity for a product often is followed by a substantial\\nreduction in sales as competitors gain regulatory approval for generic and other competing products and enter the market.\\nSimilar competition can be triggered by the loss of exclusivity for a biological product. For the Company’s MedTech\\nbusinesses, technological innovation, product quality, reputation and customer service are especially important to\\ncompetitiveness. Development by other companies of new or improved products, processes and technologies could\\nthreaten to make the Company’s products or technologies less desirable, less economical or obsolete. The Company’s\\nConsumer Health businesses face intense competition from other branded products and retailers’ private-label brands. If\\nthe Company fails to sufficiently differentiate and market its brand name consumer products, this could adversely affect\\nrevenues and profitability of those products.\\n\\nInterruptions and delays in manufacturing operations could adversely affect the Company’s business, sales\\nand reputation.\\n\\nThe Company’s manufacture of products requires the timely delivery of sufficient amounts of complex, high-quality\\ncomponents and materials. The Company’s subsidiaries operate 89 manufacturing facilities as well as sourcing from\\nthousands of suppliers around the world. The Company has in the past, and may in the future, face unanticipated\\ninterruptions and delays in manufacturing through its internal or external supply chain. Manufacturing disruptions can occur\\nfor many reasons including regulatory action, production quality deviations or safety issues, labor disputes, labor\\nshortages, site-specific incidents (such as fires), natural disasters such as hurricanes and other severe weather events,\\nraw material shortages, political unrest, terrorist attacks and epidemics or pandemics. Such delays and difficulties in\\nmanufacturing can result in product shortages, declines in sales and reputational impact as well as significant remediation\\nand related costs associated with addressing the shortage.\\n\\nThe Company relies on third parties to manufacture certain of our products. Any failure by or loss of a third-\\nparty manufacturer could result in delays and increased costs, which may adversely affect our business.\\n\\nThe Company relies on third parties to manufacture certain of our products. We depend on these third-party\\nmanufacturers to allocate to us a portion of their manufacturing capacity sufficient to meet our needs, to produce products\\nof acceptable quality and at acceptable manufacturing yields and to deliver those products to us on a timely basis and at\\nacceptable prices. However, we cannot guarantee that these third-party manufacturers will be able to meet our near-term\\nor long-term manufacturing requirements, which could result in lost sales and have an adverse effect on our business.\\n\\nOther risks associated with our reliance on third parties to manufacture these products include reliance on the third party\\nfor regulatory compliance and quality assurance, misappropriation of the Company’s intellectual property, limited ability to\\n\\n8 • Johnson & Johnson 2022 Annual Report\\n\\n\\x0cmanage our inventory, possible breach of the manufacturing agreement by the third party and the possible termination or\\nnonrenewal of the manufacturing agreement by the third party at a time that is costly or inconvenient for us. Moreover, if\\nany of our third-party manufacturers suffers any damage to facilities, loses benefits under material agreements,\\nexperiences power outages, encounters financial difficulties, is unable to secure necessary raw materials from its suppliers\\nor suffers any other reduction in efficiency, the Company may experience significant business disruption. In the event of\\nany such disruption, the Company would need to seek and source other qualified third-party manufacturers, likely resulting\\nin further delays and increased costs which could affect our business adversely.\\n\\nCounterfeit versions of our products could harm our patients and have a negative impact on our revenues,\\nearnings, reputation and business.\\n\\nOur industry continues to be challenged by the vulnerability of distribution channels to illegal counterfeiting and the\\npresence of counterfeit products in a growing number of markets and over the Internet. Third parties may illegally distribute\\nand sell counterfeit versions of our products, which do not meet our rigorous manufacturing and testing standards. To\\ndistributors and patients, counterfeit products may be visually indistinguishable from the authentic version. Counterfeit\\nmedicines pose a risk to patient health and safety because of the conditions under which they are manufactured – often in\\nunregulated, unlicensed, uninspected and unsanitary sites – as well as the lack of regulation of their contents.\\n\\nThe industry’s failure to mitigate the threat of counterfeit medicines could adversely impact our business and reputation by\\nimpacting patient confidence in our authentic products, potentially resulting in lost sales, product recalls, and an increased\\nthreat of litigation. In addition, diversion of our products from their authorized market into other channels may result in\\nreduced revenues and negatively affect our profitability.\\n\\nGlobal health crises, pandemics, epidemics, or other outbreaks could adversely disrupt or impact certain\\naspects of the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.\\n\\nWe are subject to risks associated with global health crises, epidemics, pandemics and other outbreaks (such incident(s),\\na health crisis or health crises), including the global outbreak of coronavirus and its variants (COVID-19). The COVID-19\\npandemic has adversely impacted, and may continue to adversely impact, certain aspects of the Company’s business,\\nresults of operations and financial condition, including lower sales and reduced customer demand and usage of certain of\\nour products. The continued spread of COVID-19 or other health crises may cause the Company to modify its business\\npractices, and take further actions as may be required by government authorities or as the Company determines are in the\\nbest interests of our patients, customers, employees and business partners. While the Company has robust business\\ncontinuity plans in place across our global supply chain network to help mitigate the impact of health crises, these efforts\\nmay not completely prevent our business from being adversely affected and future impacts remain uncertain.\\n\\nWhile the U.S. and other countries have substantially reopened their economies, the extent to which COVID-19, or other\\nhealth crises, could impact the Company’s future operations will depend on many factors which cannot be predicted with\\nconfidence, including the duration of an outbreak and impact of variants. A surge in COVID-19 or other health crises could\\nresult in the imposition of new mandates and prolonged restrictive measures implemented in order to control the spread of\\ndisease. The global spread of COVID-19 or other health crises could adversely impact the Company’s operations,\\nincluding, among other things, our manufacturing operations, supply chain, third-party suppliers, sales and marketing, and\\nclinical trial operations. Any of these factors could adversely affect the Company’s business, financial results, and global\\neconomic conditions generally.\\n\\nWe also face uncertainties related to our vaccine development programs, including uncertainties related to the risk that our\\ncontinued development programs may not be successful, commercially viable or receive approval from regulatory\\nauthorities; risks associated with clinical trial and real-world data, including further analyses of its efficacy, safety and\\ndurability; the risk that continued evolution and mutation of disease and the duration of a particular outbreak may impede our\\nability to conduct trials within a specified time frame; the risk that data are subject to differing interpretations and\\nassessments, including during the peer review/publication process, in the scientific community generally, and by national\\nimmunization technical advisory groups (NITAGs) and regulatory authorities; disruptions in the relationships between us, our\\nthird-party suppliers, external manufacturers, and other third parties with whom we engage; the risk that other companies\\nmay produce superior or competitive products; the risk that demand for any products we may develop may no longer exist;\\nrisks related to the availability of raw materials to manufacture any such products; the risk that we may not be able to recoup\\ncosts associated with our R&D and manufacturing efforts and risks associated with any changes in the way we approach or\\nprovide additional research funding for potential drug development; the risk that we may not be able to create or scale up\\nmanufacturing capacity on a timely basis, that we may continue to experience manufacturing delays once a manufacturing\\nsite is activated, or have access to logistics or supply channels commensurate with global demand for any potential\\napproved vaccine or product candidate, which would negatively impact our ability to supply the estimated numbers of doses\\n\\nJohnson & Johnson 2022 Annual Report • 9\\n\\n\\x0cof our vaccine within the projected time periods indicated, and other challenges and risks associated with the pace of our\\nvaccine development program; and pricing and access challenges for such products, including in the U.S.\\n\\nRisks Related to Government Regulation and Legal Proceedings\\n\\nGlobal sales in the Company’s Pharmaceutical and MedTech segments may be negatively impacted by\\nhealthcare reforms and increasing pricing pressures.\\n\\nSales of the Company’s Pharmaceutical and MedTech products are significantly affected by reimbursements by third-party\\npayers such as government healthcare programs, private insurance plans and managed care organizations. As part of\\nvarious efforts to contain healthcare costs, these payers are putting downward pressure on prices at which products will\\nbe reimbursed. In the U.S., increased purchasing power of entities that negotiate on behalf of Medicare, Medicaid, and\\nprivate sector beneficiaries, in part due to continued consolidation among healthcare providers, could result in further\\npricing pressures. In addition, recent legislation and ongoing political scrutiny or pricing, coverage and reimbursement\\ncould result in additional pricing pressures. Specifically, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) may subject certain\\nproducts to government-established pricing, potentially impose rebates, and subject manufacturers who fail to adhere to\\nthe government’s interpretations of the law to penalties. Outside the U.S., numerous major markets, including the EU,\\nUnited Kingdom, Japan and China, have pervasive government involvement in funding healthcare and, in that regard,\\ndirectly or indirectly impose price controls, limit access to, or reimbursement for, the Company’s products, or reduce the\\nvalue of its intellectual property protection.\\n\\nThe Company is subject to significant legal proceedings that can result in significant expenses, fines and\\nreputational damage.\\n\\nIn the ordinary course of business, Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries are subject to numerous claims and lawsuits\\ninvolving various issues such as product liability, patent disputes and claims that their product sales, marketing and pricing\\npractices violate various antitrust, unfair trade practices and/or consumer protection laws. The Company’s more significant\\nlegal proceedings are described in Note 19, “Legal Proceedings” under Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\\nincluded in Item 8 of this Report. Litigation, in general, and securities, derivative action, class action and multi-district\\nlitigation, in particular, can be expensive and disruptive. Some of these matters may include thousands of plaintiffs, may\\ninvolve parties seeking large and/or indeterminate amounts, including punitive or exemplary damages, and may remain\\nunresolved for several years. For example, the Company is a defendant in numerous lawsuits arising out of the use of body\\npowders containing talc, primarily JOHNSON’S Baby Powder, and the Company’s sale, manufacturing and marketing of\\nopioids. While the Company believes it has substantial defenses in these matters, it is not feasible to predict the ultimate\\noutcome of litigation. The Company could in the future be required to pay significant amounts as a result of settlements or\\njudgments in these matters, potentially in excess of accruals, including matters where the Company could be held jointly\\nand severally liable among other defendants. The resolution of, or increase in accruals for, one or more of these matters in\\nany reporting period could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations and cash flows for that\\nperiod. The Company does not purchase third-party product liability insurance; however, the Company utilizes a wholly\\nowned captive insurance company subject to certain limits.\\n\\nProduct reliability, safety and effectiveness concerns can have significant negative impacts on sales and\\nresults of operations, lead to litigation and cause reputational damage.\\n\\nConcerns about product safety, whether raised internally or by litigants, regulators or consumer advocates, and whether or\\nnot based on scientific evidence, can result in safety alerts, product recalls, governmental investigations, regulatory action\\non the part of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (or its counterpart in other countries), private claims and lawsuits,\\npayment of fines and settlements, declining sales and reputational damage. These circumstances can also result in\\ndamage to brand image, brand equity and consumer trust in the Company’s products. Product recalls have in the past,\\nand could in the future, prompt government investigations and inspections, the shutdown of manufacturing facilities,\\ncontinued product shortages and related sales declines, significant remediation costs, reputational damage, possible civil\\npenalties and criminal prosecution.\\n\\nThe Company faces significant regulatory scrutiny, which imposes significant compliance costs and\\nexposes the Company to government investigations, legal actions and penalties.\\n\\nLike other companies in the healthcare industry, the Company is subject to extensive regulation, investigations and legal\\naction by national, state and local government agencies in the U.S. and other countries in which it operates. Regulatory\\nissues regarding compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) (and comparable quality regulations in\\nforeign countries) by manufacturers of drugs, devices and consumer products can lead to fines and penalties, product\\n\\n10 • Johnson & Johnson 2022 Annual Report\\n\\n\\x0crecalls, product shortages, interruptions in production, delays in new product approvals and litigation. In addition, the\\nmarketing, pricing and sale of the Company’s products are subject to regulation, investigations and legal actions including\\nunder the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the Medicaid Rebate Program, federal and state false claims acts, state\\nunfair trade practices acts and consumer protection laws. Scrutiny of healthcare industry business practices by\\ngovernment agencies and state attorneys general in the U.S., and any resulting investigations and prosecutions, carry risk\\nof significant civil and criminal penalties including, but not limited to, debarment from participation in government\\nhealthcare programs. Any such debarment could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business and results of\\noperations. The most significant current investigations and litigation brought by government agencies are described in\\nNote 19, “Legal Proceedings—Government Proceedings” under Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included\\nin Item 8 of this Report.\\n\\nChanges in tax laws or exposures to additional tax liabilities could negatively impact the Company’s\\noperating results.\\n\\nChanges in tax laws or regulations around the world, including in the U.S. and as led by the Organization for Economic\\nCooperation and Development, such as the recent adoption by the EU, enactment by South Korea and the anticipated\\nenactment by additional countries of a global minimum tax, could negatively impact the Company’s effective tax rate and\\nresults of operations. A change in statutory tax rate or certain international tax provisions in any country would result in the\\nrevaluation of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities related to that particular jurisdiction in the period in which\\nthe new tax law is enacted. This change would result in an expense or benefit recorded to the Company’s Consolidated\\nStatement of Earnings. The Company closely monitors these proposals as they arise in the countries where it operates.\\nChanges to tax laws or regulations may occur at any time, and any related expense or benefit recorded may be material to\\nthe fiscal quarter and year in which the law change is enacted.\\n\\nSee Note 8, “Income Taxes” under Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report for\\nadditional information.\\n\\nThe Company conducts business and files tax returns in numerous countries and is addressing tax audits and disputes\\nwith many tax authorities. In connection with various government initiatives, companies are required to disclose more\\ninformation to tax authorities on operations around the world, which may lead to greater audit scrutiny of profits earned in\\nother countries. The Company regularly assesses the likely outcomes of its tax audits and disputes to determine the\\nappropriateness of its tax reserves. However, any tax authority could take a position on tax treatment that is contrary to the\\nCompany’s expectations, which could result in tax liabilities in excess of reserves.\\n\\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\\n\\nThe Company faces increased challenges to intellectual property rights central to its business.\\n\\nThe Company owns or licenses a significant number of patents and other proprietary rights relating to its products and\\nmanufacturing processes. These rights are essential to the Company’s businesses and materially important to the\\nCompany’s results of operations. Public policy, both within and outside the U.S., has become increasingly unfavorable\\ntoward intellectual property rights. The Company cannot be certain that it will obtain adequate patent protection for new\\nproducts and technologies in the United States and other important markets or that such protections, once granted, will\\nlast as long as originally anticipated.\\n\\nCompetitors routinely challenge the validity or extent of the Company’s owned or licensed patents and proprietary rights\\nthrough litigation, interferences, oppositions and other proceedings, such as inter partes review (IPR) proceedings before\\nthe United States Patent & Trademark Office (USPTO). These proceedings absorb resources and can be protracted as\\nwell as unpredictable. In addition, challenges that the Company’s products infringe the patents of third parties could result\\nin an injunction and/or the need to pay past damages and future royalties and adversely affect the competitive position and\\nsales of the products in question.\\n\\nThe Company has faced increasing patent challenges from third parties seeking to manufacture and market generic and\\nbiosimilar versions of the Company’s key pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering\\nthose products. In the U.S., manufacturers of generic versions of innovative human pharmaceutical products may\\nchallenge the validity, or claim non-infringement, of innovator products through the Abbreviated New Drug Application, or\\nANDA, process with the U.S. FDA and related ANDA litigation. The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act\\n(BPCIA), enacted in 2010, which created a new regulatory pathway for the approval by the U.S. FDA of biosimilar\\nalternatives to innovator-developed biological products, also created mechanisms for biosimilar applicants to challenge the\\npatents on the innovator biologics. The IPR process with the USPTO is also being used by competitors to challenge\\npatents asserted in litigation.\\n\\nJohnson & Johnson 2022 Annual Report • 11\\n\\n\\x0cIn the event the Company is not successful in defending its patents against such challenges, or upon the “at-risk” launch\\nby the generic or biosimilar firm of its product, the Company can lose a major portion of revenues for the referenced\\nproduct in a very short period of time. Current legal proceedings involving the Company’s patents and other intellectual\\nproperty rights are described in Note 19, “Legal Proceedings—Intellectual Property” under Notes to the Consolidated\\nFinancial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report.\\n\\nRisks Related to Product Development, Regulatory Approval and Commercialization\\n\\nSignificant challenges or delays in the Company’s innovation and development of new products,\\ntechnologies and indications could have an adverse impact on the Company’s long-term success.\\n\\nThe Company’s continued growth and success depends on its ability to innovate and develop new and differentiated\\nproducts and services that address the evolving healthcare needs of patients, providers and consumers. Development of\\nsuccessful products and technologies is also necessary to offset revenue losses when the Company’s existing products\\nlose market share due to various factors such as competition and loss of patent exclusivity. New products introduced\\nwithin the past five years accounted for approximately 25% of 2022 sales. The Company cannot be certain when or\\nwhether it will be able to develop, license or otherwise acquire companies, products and technologies, whether particular\\nproduct candidates will be granted regulatory approval, and, if approved, whether the products will be commercially\\nsuccessful.\\n\\nThe Company pursues product development through internal research and development as well as through collaborations,\\nacquisitions, joint ventures and licensing or other arrangements with third parties. In all of these contexts, developing new\\nproducts, particularly pharmaceutical and biotechnology products and medical devices, requires significant investment of\\nresources over many years. Only a very few biopharmaceutical research and development programs result in commercially\\nviable products. The process depends on many factors including the ability to: discern patients’ and healthcare providers’\\nfuture needs; develop promising new compounds, strategies and technologies; achieve successful clinical trial results;\\nsecure effective intellectual property protection; obtain regulatory approvals on a timely basis; and, if and when they reach\\nthe market, successfully differentiate the Company’s products from competing products and approaches to treatment.\\nNew products or enhancements to existing products may not be accepted quickly or significantly in the marketplace due\\nto product and price competition, changes in customer preferences or healthcare purchasing patterns, resistance by\\nhealthcare providers or uncertainty over third-party reimbursement. Even following initial regulatory approval, the success\\nof a product can be adversely impacted by safety and efficacy findings in larger real-world patient populations, as well as\\nmarket entry of competitive products.\\n\\nRisks Related to Financial and Economic Market Conditions\\n\\nThe Company faces a variety of financial, economic, legal, social and political risks associated with\\nconducting business internationally.\\n\\nThe Company’s extensive operations and business activity throughout the world are accompanied by certain financial,\\neconomic, legal, social and political risks, including those listed below.\\n\\nForeign Currency Exchange: In fiscal 2022, approximately 49% of the Company’s sales occurred outside of the U.S., with\\napproximately 25% in Europe, 6% in the Western Hemisphere, excluding the U.S., and 18% in the Asia-Pacific and Africa\\nregion. Changes in non-U.S. currencies relative to the U.S. dollar impact the Company’s revenues and expenses. While\\nthe Company uses financial instruments to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates on its cash flows,\\nunhedged exposures continue to be subject to currency fluctuations. In addition, the weakening or strengthening of the\\nU.S. dollar may result in significant favorable or unfavorable translation effects when the operating results of the\\nCompany’s non-U.S. business activity are translated into U.S. dollars.\\n\\nInflation and Currency Devaluation Risks: The Company faces challenges in maintaining profitability of operations in\\neconomies experiencing high inflation rates. Specifically, the Company has accounted for operations in Argentina, Turkey\\nand Venezuela as highly inflationary, as the prior three-year cumulative inflation rate surpassed 100%. While the Company\\nstrives to maintain profit margins in these areas through cost reduction programs, productivity improvements and periodic\\nprice increases, it might experience operating losses as a result of continued inflation. In addition, the impact of currency\\ndevaluations in countries experiencing high inflation rates or significant currency exchange fluctuations could negatively\\nimpact the Company’s operating results.\\n\\nIllegal Importation of Pharmaceutical Products: The illegal importation of pharmaceutical products from countries where\\ngovernment price controls or other market dynamics result in lower prices may adversely affect the Company’s sales and\\n\\n12 • Johnson & Johnson 2022 Annual Report\\n\\n\\x0cprofitability in the U.S. and other countries in which the Company operates. With the exception of limited quantities of\\nprescription drugs for personal use, foreign imports of pharmaceutical products are illegal under current U.S. law.\\nHowever, the volume of illegal imports continues to rise as the ability of patients and other customers to obtain the lower-\\npriced imports has grown significantly.\\n\\nAnti-Bribery and Other Regulations: The Company is subject to various federal and foreign laws that govern its international\\nbusiness practices with respect to payments to government officials. Those laws include the U.S. Foreign Corrupt\\nPractices Act (FCPA), which prohibits U.S. publicly traded companies from promising, offering, or giving anything of value\\nto foreign officials with the corrupt intent of influencing the foreign official for the purpose of helping the Company obtain\\nor retain business or gain any improper advantage. The Company’s business is heavily regulated and therefore involves\\nsignificant interaction with foreign officials. Also, in many countries outside the U.S., the healthcare providers who\\nprescribe human pharmaceuticals are employed by the government and the purchasers of human pharmaceuticals are\\ngovernment entities; therefore, the Company’s interactions with these prescribers and purchasers are subject to regulation\\nunder the FCPA. In addition to the U.S. application and enforcement of the FCPA, various jurisdictions in which the\\nCompany operates have laws and regulations, including the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, aimed at preventing and penalizing\\ncorrupt and anticompetitive behavior. Enforcement activities under these laws could subject the Company to additional\\nadministrative and legal proceedings and actions, which could include claims for civil penalties, criminal sanctions, and\\nadministrative remedies, including exclusion from healthcare programs.\\n\\nOther Financial, Economic, Legal, Social and Political Risks. Other risks inherent in conducting business globally include:\\n• local and regional economic environments and policies in the markets that we serve, including interest rates, monetary\\npolicy, inflation, economic growth, recession, commodity prices, and currency controls or other limitations on the ability\\nto expatriate cash;\\n\\n• protective economic policies taken by governments, such as trade protection measures and import/export licensing\\n\\nrequirements;\\n\\n• compliance with local regulations and laws including, in some countries, regulatory requirements restricting the\\n\\nCompany’s ability to manufacture or sell its products in the relevant market;\\n\\n• diminished protection of intellectual property and contractual rights in certain jurisdictions;\\n• potential nationalization or expropriation of the Company’s foreign assets;\\n• political or social upheavals, economic instability, repression, or human rights issues; and\\n• geopolitical events, including natural disasters, disruptions to markets due to war, armed conflict, terrorism, epidemics or\\n\\npandemics.\\n\\nFailure to maintain a satisfactory credit rating could adversely affect our liquidity, capital position,\\nborrowing costs and access to capital markets.\\n\\nWe currently maintain investment grade credit ratings with Moody’s Investors Service and Standard & Poor’s Ratings\\nServices. Rating agencies routinely evaluate us, and their ratings of our long-term and short-term debt are based on a\\nnumber of factors. Any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency, whether as a result of our actions or\\nfactors which are beyond our control, can increase the cost of borrowing under any indebtedness we may incur, reduce\\nmarket capacity for our commercial paper or require the posting of additional collateral under our derivative contracts.\\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our credit ratings, and any additional actual or anticipated\\nchanges or downgrades in our credit ratings, including any announcement that our ratings are under review for a\\ndowngrade, may have a negative impact on our liquidity, capital position and access to capital markets.\\n\\nThe Russia-Ukraine War, and actions taken in response to the Russia-Ukraine War, could adversely affect\\nour business, results of operations or financial condition.\\n\\nIn February 2022, Russia launched a military invasion of Ukraine. The ongoing Russia-Ukraine War has provoked strong\\nreactions from the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union and various other countries and economic and\\npolitical organizations around the world. We have been monitoring the geopolitical situation in Russia since the start of the\\nRussia-Ukraine War and have suspended additional investment, enrollment of clinical trials, and supply of our personal\\ncare products in Russia. We continue to monitor the need for humanitarian relief in the region and continue to supply our\\nmedicines, medical devices and equipment in the region in compliance with the applicable sanctions. We will continue to\\nmonitor the geopolitical situation in Russia and to evaluate our activities and future operations in Russia.\\n\\nActions taken in response to the Russia-Ukraine War include the imposition of export controls and broad financial and\\neconomic sanctions against Russia, Belarus and specific areas of Ukraine. Additional sanctions or other measures may be\\nimposed by the global community, including but not limited to limitations on our ability to file, prosecute and maintain\\n\\nJohnson & Johnson 2022 Annual Report • 13\\n\\n\\x0cpatents, trademarks and other intellectual property rights. Furthermore, the Russian government has already taken action\\nallowing Russian companies and individuals to exploit inventions owned by patent holders from the United States and\\nmany other countries without consent or compensation and we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our\\ninventions in Russia or from selling or importing products in and into Russia.\\n\\nWe have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, other risks related to the broad economic consequences of\\nthe Russia-Ukraine War, including foreign currency volatility, decreased demand for our products in countries affected by\\nthe Russia-Ukraine War and challenges to our global supply chain related to increased costs of materials and other inputs\\nfor our products and suppliers operating in Russia and Ukraine. We also continue to monitor the various sanctions and\\nexport controls imposed in response to the Russia-Ukraine War.\\n\\nThe full impact of the Russia-Ukraine War, and actions taken in response to the ongoing conflict, on the global economy\\nand geopolitical relations, in general, and on our business in particular, remain uncertain. Any or all of the foregoing risks\\ncould have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition, particularly as the conflict\\ncontinues for an indefinite period of time. Given that developments concerning the Russia-Ukraine War are ongoing and\\nhave been constantly evolving, additional impacts and risks may arise that are not presently known to us. The Russia-\\nUkraine War may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this “Risk Factors” section.\\n\\nRisks Related to the Planned Separation of our Consumer Health Business\\n\\nThe planned separation of the Company’s Consumer Health business may not be completed on the terms\\nor timeline currently contemplated, if at all, and may not achieve the expected results.\\n\\nIn November 2021, the Company announced its intention to separate the Company’s Consumer Health business, with the\\nintention to create a standalone publicly traded company, which was subsequently named Kenvue, Inc. (“Kenvue”). The\\nplanned separation is intended to qualify as a tax-free transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The Company is\\ntargeting completion of the planned separation in 2023. Completion of the planned separation will be subject to the\\nsatisfaction of certain conditions, including, among others, consultations with works councils and other employee\\nrepresentative bodies, as required, final approval by the Company’s Board of Directors, the continuing effectiveness and\\nvalidity of the Company’s private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and receipt of favorable opinions of\\nthe Company’s U.S. tax advisors with respect to the tax-free nature of the transaction, and the receipt of other regulatory\\napprovals. There can be no assurance regarding the ultimate timing of the planned separation or that such separation will\\nbe completed. Unanticipated developments could delay, prevent or otherwise adversely affect the planned separation,\\nincluding but not limited to disruptions in general or financial market conditions or potential problems or delays in obtaining\\nvarious regulatory and tax approvals or clearances.\\n\\nThe costs to complete the planned separation will be significant. In addition, the Company may be unable\\nto achieve some or all of the strategic and financial benefits that it expects to achieve from the planned\\nseparation of the Company’s Consumer Health business.\\n\\nThe Company has incurred, and is expected to incur, significant expenses in connection with the planned separation. In\\naddition, the Company may not be able to achieve the full strategic and financial benefits that are expected to result from\\nthe planned separation. The anticipated benefits of the planned separation are based on a number of assumptions, some\\nof which may prove incorrect.\\n\\nFollowing the planned separation, the price of shares of the Company’s common stock may\\nfluctuate significantly.\\n\\nThe Company cannot predict the effect of the planned separation on the trading price of shares of its common stock, and\\nthe market value of shares of its common stock may be less than, equal to or greater than the market value of shares of its\\ncommon stock prior to the planned separation. In addition, the price of the Company’s common stock may be more volatile\\naround the time of the planned separation.\\n\\nThe planned separation could result in substantial tax liability.\\n\\nThe Company has received a private letter ruling from the IRS as to the tax-free nature of the planned separation under the\\nU.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The planned separation is conditioned on, among other things, the\\ncontinuing effectiveness and validity of the Company’s private letter ruling from the IRS and receipt of favorable opinions of\\nthe Company’s U.S. tax advisors. The private letter ruling and opinions will be based on, among other things, various facts,\\nassumptions, representations and undertakings from the Company and Kenvue regarding the past and future conduct of\\n\\n14 • Johnson & Johnson 2022 Annual Report\\n\\n\\x0cthe companies’ respective businesses and other matters. If any of these facts, assumptions, representations or\\nundertakings are incorrect or not otherwise satisfied, the Company and its shareholders may not be able to rely on the\\nruling or the opinions of tax advisors. Notwithstanding the private letter ruling and opinions of tax advisors, if subsequent to\\nthe planned separation the IRS determines that certain steps of the transaction do not qualify for tax-free treatment for\\nU.S. federal income tax purposes, the resulting tax liability to the Company and its shareholders could be substantial. The\\nplanned separation may also not qualify for tax-free treatment in other countries around the world, and as a result may\\ntrigger substantial tax liability to the Company.\\n\\nOther Risks\\n\\nOur business depends on our ability to recruit and retain talented, highly skilled employees and a diverse\\nworkforce.\\n\\nOur continued growth requires us to recruit and retain talented employees representing diverse backgrounds, experiences,\\nand skill sets. The market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive and our ability to\\ncompete depends on our ability to hire, develop and motivate highly skilled personnel in all areas of our organization.\\nMaintaining our brand and reputation, as well as a diverse, equitable and inclusive work environment enables us to attract\\ntop talent. If we are less successful in our recruiting efforts, or if we cannot retain highly skilled workers and key leaders,\\nour ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected. In addition, effective\\nsuccession planning is important to our long-term success. Any unsuccessful implementation of our succession plans or\\nfailure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could adversely affect our\\nbusiness, financial condition, or results of operations.\\n\\nClimate change or legal, regulatory or market measures to address climate change may negatively affect\\nour business and results of operations.\\n\\nClimate change resulting from increased concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere\\ncould present risks to our operations, including an adverse impact on global temperatures, weather patterns and the\\nfrequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters. Natural disasters and extreme weather conditions, such\\nas a hurricane, tornado, earthquake, wildfire or flooding, may pose physical risks to our facilities and disrupt the operation\\nof our supply chain. The impacts of the changing climate on water resources may result in water scarcity, limiting our ability\\nto access sufficient high-quality water in certain locations, which may increase operational costs.\\n\\nConcern over climate change may also result in new or additional legal or regulatory requirements designed to reduce\\ngreenhouse gas emissions and/or mitigate the effects of climate change on the environment. If such laws or regulations\\nare more stringent than current legal or regulatory obligations, we may experience disruption in, or an increase in the costs\\nassociated with sourcing, manufacturing and distribution of our products, which may adversely affect our business, results\\nof operations or financial condition. Further, the impacts of climate change have an influence on customer preferences,\\nand failure to provide climate-friendly products could potentially result in loss of market share.\\n\\nAn information security incident, including a cybersecurity breach, could have a negative impact to the\\nCompany’s business or reputation.\\n\\nTo meet business objectives, the Company relies on both internal information technology (IT) systems and networks, and\\nthose of third parties and their vendors, to process and store sensitive data, including confidential research, business\\nplans, financial information, intellectual property, and personal data that may be subject to legal protection, and ensure the\\ncontinuity of the Company’s supply chain. The extensive information security and cybersecurity threats, which affect\\ncompanies globally, pose a risk to the security and availability of these systems and networks, and the confidentiality,\\nintegrity, and availability of the Company’s sensitive data. The Company continually assesses these threats and makes\\ninvestments to increase internal protection, detection, and response capabilities, as well as ensure the Company’s third-\\nparty providers have required capabilities and controls, to address this risk. To date, the Company has not experienced any\\nmaterial impact to the business or operations resulting from information or cybersecurity attacks; however, because of the\\nfrequently changing attack techniques, along with the increased volume and sophistication of the attacks, there is the\\npotential for the Company to be adversely impacted. This impact could result in reputational, competitive, operational or\\nother business harm as well as financial costs and regulatory action. The Company maintains cybersecurity insurance in\\nthe event of an information security or cyber incident; however, the coverage may not be sufficient to cover all financial,\\nlegal, business or reputational losses.\\n\\nAs a result of the Russia-Ukraine War, there has been, and we expect there will continue to be, an increased risk of\\ninformation security or cybersecurity incidents, including cyberattacks perpetrated by Russia or others at its direction.\\n\\nJohnson & Johnson 2022 Annual Report • 15\\n\\n\\x0cAlthough we have taken steps to enhance our protections against these attacks, we may not be able to address the threat\\nof information security or cybersecurity incidents proactively or implement adequate preventative measures and we may\\nnot be able to detect and address any such disruption or security breach promptly, or at all, which could adversely affect\\nour business, results of operations or financial condition. Moreover, we are aware of incidents in which our third-party\\npartners have been the target of information security or cybersecurity incidents as a result of the Russia-Ukraine War.\\nAlthough, to date, our IT Systems have not been compromised by these incidents, it is possible that future information\\nsecurity or cybersecurity incidents involving our customers, manufacturers, suppliers or other third-party partners could\\nsuccessfully compromise our IT Systems, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial\\ncondition.\\n\\nA breach of privacy laws or unauthorized access, loss or misuse of personal data could have a negative\\nimpact to the Company’s business or reputation.\\n\\nThe Company is subject to privacy and data protection laws across the globe that impose broad compliance obligations\\non the collection, use, storage, access, transfer and protection of personal data. Breach of such requirements could result\\nin substantial fines, penalties, private right of actions, claims and damage to our reputation and business. New privacy laws\\nare expected in other territories, together with greater privacy enforcement by governmental authorities globally, particularly\\non data localization requirements and international data flows. The Company has established privacy compliance programs\\nand controls that our businesses worldwide are required to comply with, but with many technology and data-driven\\ninitiatives being prioritized across the Company and involving multiple vendors and third parties, there are potential risks of\\ncontrols imposed on cross border data flows, unauthorized access, and loss of personal data through internal and external\\nthreats that could impact our business operations and research activities.\\n\\nItem 1B.

These products are marketed to the\\ngeneral public and sold online (eCommerce) and to retail outlets and distributors throughout the world. The\\nPharmaceutical segment is focused on the following therapeutic areas, including Immunology, Infectious diseases,\\nNeuroscience, Oncology, Pulmonary Hypertension, and Cardiovascular and Metabolic diseases. Products in this segment\\nare distributed directly to retailers, wholesalers, distributors, hospitals and healthcare professionals for prescription use.\\nThe MedTech segment includes a broad portfolio of products used in the Orthopaedic, Surgery, Interventional Solutions\\n(cardiovascular and neurovascular) and Vision fields. These products are distributed to wholesalers, hospitals and retailers,\\nand used principally in the professional fields by physicians, nurses, hospitals, eye care professionals and clinics.\\n\\nThe Executive Committee of Johnson & Johnson is the principal management group responsible for the strategic\\noperations and allocation of the resources of the Company. This Committee oversees and coordinates the activities of the\\nConsumer Health, Pharmaceutical and MedTech business segments.\\n\\nIn all of its product lines, the Company competes with other companies both locally and globally, throughout the world.\\nCompetition exists in all product lines without regard to the number and size of the competing companies involved.\\nCompetition in research, involving the development and the improvement of new and existing products and processes, is\\nparticularly significant. The development of new and innovative products, as well as protecting the underlying intellectual\\nproperty of the Company’s product portfolio, is important to the Company’s success in all areas of its business. The\\ncompetitive environment requires substantial investments in continuing research. In addition, the development and\\nmaintenance of customer demand for the Company’s consumer products involves significant expenditures for advertising\\nand promotion.\\n\\nManagement’s Objectives\\n\\nWith “Our Credo” as the foundation, the Company’s purpose is to blend heart, science and ingenuity to profoundly\\nchange the trajectory of health for humanity. The Company is committed to bringing its full breadth and depth to ensure\\nhealth for people today and for future generations. United around this common ambition, the Company is poised to fulfill its\\npurpose and successfully meet the demands of the rapidly evolving markets in which it competes.\\n\\nThe Company is broadly based in human healthcare, and is committed to creating value by developing accessible, high\\nquality, innovative products and services. New products introduced within the past five years accounted for approximately\\n25% of 2022 sales. In 2022, $14.6 billion was invested in research and development reflecting management’s\\ncommitment to create life-enhancing innovations and to create value through partnerships that will profoundly change the\\ntrajectory of health for humanity.\\n\\nA critical driver of the Company’s success is the diversity of its 152,700 employees worldwide. Employees are\\nempowered and inspired to lead with Our Credo and purpose as guides.

Operational growth was driven by strong uptake of STELARA (ustekinumab) in Crohn’s disease and Ulcerative\\nColitis and strength of TREMFYA (guselkumab) in Psoriasis and uptake in Psoriatic Arthritis. This was partially offset by\\nlower sales of REMICADE (infliximab) due to biosimilar competition.\\n\\nBiosimilar versions of REMICADE have been introduced in the United States and certain markets outside the United\\nStates and additional competitors continue to enter the market. Continued infliximab biosimilar competition will result in a\\nfurther reduction in sales of REMICADE.\\n\\nThe latest expiring United States patent for STELARA (ustekinumab) will expire in September 2023. STELARA\\n(ustekinumab) U.S. sales in fiscal 2022 were approximately $6.4 billion and the expiration of this product patent or loss of\\nmarket exclusivity will result in a reduction in sales.\\n\\nInfectious disease products sales were $5.4 billion in 2022, representing a decline of 6.5% as compared to the prior year.\\nOperational growth was driven by the COVID-19 vaccine outside the U.S partially offset by lower sales of PREZISTA and\\nPREZCOBIX/REZOLSTA (darunavir/cobicistat) due to increased competition and loss of exclusivity of PREZISTA in\\ncertain countries outside the U.S.\\n\\nNeuroscience products sales were $6.9 billion, in 2022, representing a decline of 1.4% as compared to the prior year.\\nThe operational sales growth of INVEGA SUSTENNA/XEPLION (paliperidone palmitate) and INVEGA TRINZA/TREVICTA\\nfrom new patient starts and persistence as well as the launch of INVEGA HAFYERA was offset by negative currency\\nimpacts and lower sales of RISPERDAL CONSTA.\\n\\nOncology products achieved sales of $16.0 billion in 2022, representing an increase of 9.9% as compared to the prior\\nyear. Contributions to operational growth were strong sales of DARZALEX (daratumumab) driven by share gains in all\\nregions, continued strong market growth, and uptake of the subcutaneous formulation as well as the continued global\\nlaunch uptake of ERLEADA (apalutamide). This was partially offset by declining sales of IMBRUVICA (ibrutinib) due to\\ncompetitive pressures and market suppression and ZYTIGA due to loss of exclusivity in the European Union in the second\\nhalf of 2022.\\n\\nPulmonary Hypertension products sales were $3.4 billion, a decline of 1.0% as compared to the prior year. The\\noperational sales growth of OPSUMIT (macitentan) and UPTRAVI (selexipag) due to continued share gains and market\\ngrowth was offset by COVID-19 related impacts and continued declines in Other Pulmonary Hypertension.\\n\\nCardiovascular/Metabolism/Other products sales were $3.9 billion, a decline of 5.6% as compared to the prior year. The\\noperational decline was primarily attributable to lower sales of INVOKANA/INVOKAMET (canagliflozin) due to share\\nerosion and PROCRIT/ EPREX (epoetin alfa) due to biosimilar competition.\\n\\nThe Company updated its policy so that no end customer will be permitted direct delivery of product to a location other\\nthan the billing location. The policy impacts contract pharmacy transactions involving non-grantee 340B covered entities\\nfor most of the Company’s drugs, subject to multiple exceptions. Both grantee and non-grantee covered entities can\\nmaintain certain contract pharmacy arrangements under policy exceptions.

The debt balance at the\\nend of 2022 was $39.7 billion as compared to $33.8 billion in 2021. Considering recent market conditions, the Company\\nhas re-evaluated its operating cash flows and liquidity profile and does not foresee any significant incremental risk. The\\nCompany anticipates that operating cash flows, the ability to raise funds from external sources, borrowing capacity from\\nexisting committed credit facilities and access to the commercial paper markets will continue to provide sufficient\\nresources to fund operating needs, including the Company’s remaining balance to be paid on the agreement to settle\\nopioid litigation for approximately $2.7 billion and the establishment of the $2.0 billion trust for talc related liabilities (See\\nNote 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details). In addition, the Company monitors the global\\ncapital markets on an ongoing basis and from time to time may raise capital when market conditions are favorable.\\nEffective beginning in fiscal 2022, the U.S. Tax Cuts and Job Act of 2017 (TCJA) requires the Company to deduct U.S.\\nand international research and development expenditures for tax purposes over 5 to 15 years, instead of in the current\\nfiscal year. As a result, in fiscal 2022, the Company experienced an increase in annual cash tax payments of approximately\\n$1.2 billion above what otherwise would have been remitted to the U.S Treasury. The Company concurrently records a\\ndeferred tax benefit for the future amortization of the research and development (R&D) for tax purposes. The requirement\\nto expense R&D as incurred is unchanged for U.S. GAAP purposes and the impact to pre-tax R&D expense is not affected\\nby this provision.\\n\\nOn September 14, 2022, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program,\\nauthorizing the Company to purchase up to $5.0 billion of the Company’s Common Stock.

Gains or losses\\non these contracts are offset by the gains or losses on the underlying transactions. A 10% appreciation of the U.S. Dollar\\nfrom the January 1, 2023 market rates would increase the unrealized value of the Company’s forward contracts by\\n$0.1 billion. Conversely, a 10% depreciation of the U.S. Dollar from the January 1, 2023 market rates would decrease the\\nunrealized value of the Company’s forward contracts by $0.1 billion. In either scenario, the gain or loss on the forward\\ncontract would be offset by the gain or loss on the underlying transaction, and therefore, would have no impact on future\\nanticipated earnings and cash flows.\\n\\nThe Company hedges the exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, and the effect on certain assets and\\nliabilities in foreign currency, by entering into currency swap contracts. A 1% change in the spread between U.S. and\\nforeign interest rates on the Company’s interest rate sensitive financial instruments would either increase or decrease the\\nunrealized value of the Company’s swap contracts by approximately $1.7 billion. In either scenario, at maturity, the gain or\\nloss on the swap contract would be offset by the gain or loss on the underlying transaction, and therefore, would have no\\nimpact on future anticipated cash flows.\\n\\nThe Company does not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Further, the Company has a\\npolicy of only entering into contracts with parties that have at least an investment grade credit rating. The counterparties to\\nthese contracts are major financial institutions and there is no significant concentration of exposure with any one\\ncounterparty. Management believes the risk of loss is remote. The Company entered into credit support agreements\\n(CSA) with certain derivative counterparties establishing collateral thresholds based on respective credit ratings and\\nnetting agreements. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details on credit support\\nagreements.\\n\\nThe Company invests in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning securities which carry a degree of interest rate\\nrisk. The fair market value of fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating\\nrate securities may produce less income than predicted if interest rates fall. A 1% (100 basis points) change in spread on\\nthe Company’s interest rate sensitive investments would either increase or decrease the unrealized value of cash\\nequivalents and current marketable securities by less than $0.1 billion.\\n\\nThe Company has access to substantial sources of funds at numerous banks worldwide. In September 2022, the\\nCompany secured a new 364-day Credit Facility of $10 billion, which expires on September 7, 2023. In November 2022,\\nthe Company secured an additional 364-day revolving Credit Facility of $10 billion, which has an expiration of\\nNovember 21, 2023. Interest charged on borrowings under the credit line agreement is based on either Secured\\nOvernight Financing Rate (SOFR) Reference Rate or other applicable market rate as allowed plus applicable margins.\\nCommitment fees under the agreement are not material.\\n\\nTotal borrowings at the end of 2022 and 2021 were $39.7 billion and $33.8 billion, respectively. The increase in\\nborrowings was due to the acquisition of Abiomed, Inc. In 2022, net debt (cash and current marketable securities, net of\\ndebt) was $16.1 billion compared to net debt of $2.1 billion in 2021. Total debt represented 34.1% of total capital\\n(shareholders’ equity and total debt) in 2022 and 31.3% of total capital in 2021. Shareholders’ equity per share at the end\\nof 2022 was $29.39 compared to $28.16 at year-end 2021.\\n\\nA summary of borrowings can be found in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\\n\\nDividends\\n\\nThe Company increased its dividend in 2022 for the 60th consecutive year. Cash dividends paid were $4.45 per share in\\n2022 and $4.19 per share in 2021.\\n\\nOn January 3, 2023, the Board of Directors declared a regular cash dividend of $1.13 per share, payable on March 7,\\n2023 to shareholders of record as of February 21, 2023.\\n\\nOther Information\\n\\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\\n\\nManagement’s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition are based on the Company’s\\nconsolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in\\n\\nJohnson & Johnson 2022 Annual Report • 35\\n\\n\\x0cthe U.S. (GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements requires that management make estimates and\\nassumptions that affect the amounts reported for revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities and other related disclosures.\\nActual results may or may not differ from these estimates. The Company believes that the understanding of certain key\\naccounting policies and estimates are essential in achieving more insight into the Company’s operating results and\\nfinancial condition. These key accounting policies include revenue recognition, income taxes, legal and self-insurance\\ncontingencies, valuation of long-lived assets, assumptions used to determine the amounts recorded for pensions and other\\nemployee benefit plans and accounting for stock based awards.\\n\\nRevenue Recognition: The Company recognizes revenue from product sales when obligations under the terms of a\\ncontract with the customer are satisfied; generally, this occurs with the transfer of control of the goods to customers. The\\nCompany’s global payment terms are typically between 30 to 90 days. Provisions for certain rebates, sales incentives,\\ntrade promotions, coupons, product returns, discounts to customers and governmental clawback provisions are accounted\\nfor as variable consideration and recorded as a reduction in sales.\\n\\nProduct discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct, indirect and other market participants, as\\nwell as market conditions, including consideration of competitor pricing. Rebates are estimated based on contractual\\nterms, historical experience, patient outcomes, trend analysis and projected market conditions in the various markets\\nserved. The Company evaluates market conditions for products or groups of products primarily through the analysis of\\nwholesaler and other third-party sell-through and market research data, as well as internally generated information.\\n\\nSales returns are estimated and recorded based on historical sales and returns information. Products that exhibit unusual\\nsales or return patterns due to dating, competition or other marketing matters are specifically investigated and analyzed as\\npart of the accounting for sales return accruals.\\n\\nSales returns allowances represent a reserve for products that may be returned due to expiration, destruction in the field,\\nor in specific areas, product recall. The sales returns reserve is based on historical return trends by product and by market\\nas a percent to gross sales. In accordance with the Company’s accounting policies, the Company generally issues credit\\nto customers for returned goods. The Company’s sales returns reserves are accounted for in accordance with the\\nU.S. GAAP guidance for revenue recognition when right of return exists. Sales returns reserves are recorded at full sales\\nvalue. Sales returns in the Consumer Health and Pharmaceutical segments are almost exclusively not resalable. Sales\\nreturns for certain franchises in the MedTech segment are typically resalable but are not material. The Company\\ninfrequently exchanges products from inventory for returned products. The sales returns reserve for the total Company has\\nbeen approximately 1.0% of annual net trade sales during the fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020.\\n\\nPromotional programs, such as product listing allowances and cooperative advertising arrangements, are recorded in the\\nsame period as related sales. Continuing promotional programs include coupons and volume-based sales incentive\\nprograms. The redemption cost of consumer coupons is based on historical redemption experience by product and value.\\nVolume-based incentive programs are based on the estimated sales volumes for the incentive period and are recorded as\\nproducts are sold. These arrangements are evaluated to determine the appropriate amounts to be deferred or recorded as\\na reduction of revenue. The Company also earns profit-share payments through collaborative arrangements of certain\\nproducts, which are included in sales to customers. Profit-share payments were less than 2.0% of the total revenues in\\nfiscal year 2022 and less than 3.0% of the total revenues in fiscal years 2021 and 2020 and are included in sales to\\ncustomers.\\n\\nIn addition, the Company enters into collaboration arrangements that contain multiple revenue generating activities.\\nAmounts due from collaborative partners for these arrangements are recognized as each activity is performed or delivered,\\nbased on the relative selling price. Upfront fees received as part of these arrangements are deferred and recognized over\\nthe performance period. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional disclosures on collaborations.\\n\\nReasonably likely changes to assumptions used to calculate the accruals for rebates, returns and promotions are not\\nanticipated to have a material effect on the financial statements. The Company currently discloses the impact of changes\\nto assumptions in the quarterly or annual filing in which there is a material financial statement impact.\\n\\n36 • Johnson & Johnson 2022 Annual Report\\n\\n\\x0cBelow are tables that show the progression of accrued rebates, returns, promotions, reserve for doubtful accounts and\\nreserve for cash discounts by segment of business for the fiscal years ended January 1, 2023 and January 2, 2022.\\n\\nConsumer Health Segment\\n\\n(Dollars in Millions)\\n\\n2022\\n\\nAccrued rebates(1)\\n\\nAccrued returns\\n\\nAccrued promotions\\n\\nSubtotal\\n\\nReserve for doubtful accounts\\n\\nReserve for cash discounts\\n\\nTotal\\n\\n2021\\n\\nAccrued rebates(1)\\n\\nAccrued returns\\n\\nAccrued promotions\\n\\nSubtotal\\n\\nReserve for doubtful accounts\\n\\nReserve for cash discounts\\n\\nTotal\\n\\nBalance at\\nBeginning\\nof Period\\n\\nAccruals\\n\\nPayments/\\nCredits\\n\\nBalance at\\nEnd of\\nPeriod\\n\\n$287\\n\\n76\\n\\n387\\n\\n$750\\n\\n32\\n\\n15\\n\\n1,052\\n\\n83\\n\\n2,077\\n\\n3,212\\n\\n5\\n\\n210\\n\\n(948)\\n\\n(88)\\n\\n(2,008)\\n\\n(3,044)\\n\\n(3)\\n\\n(208)\\n\\n$797\\n\\n3,427\\n\\n(3,255)\\n\\n$289\\n\\n76\\n\\n428\\n\\n$793\\n\\n39\\n\\n12\\n\\n893\\n\\n136\\n\\n1,958\\n\\n2,987\\n\\n0\\n\\n213\\n\\n(895)\\n\\n(136)\\n\\n(1,999)\\n\\n(3,030)\\n\\n(7)\\n\\n(210)\\n\\n$844\\n\\n3,200\\n\\n(3,247)\\n\\n391\\n\\n71\\n\\n456\\n\\n918\\n\\n34\\n\\n17\\n\\n969\\n\\n287\\n\\n76\\n\\n387\\n\\n750\\n\\n32\\n\\n15\\n\\n797\\n\\n(1)\\n\\nIncludes reserve for customer rebates of $82 million at January 1, 2023 and $80 million at January 2, 2022, recorded as a contra\\nasset.\\n\\nPharmaceutical Segment\\n\\n(Dollars in Millions)\\n\\n2022\\n\\nAccrued rebates(1)\\n\\nAccrued returns\\n\\nAccrued promotions\\n\\nSubtotal\\n\\nReserve for doubtful accounts\\n\\nReserve for cash discounts\\n\\nTotal\\n\\n2021\\n\\nAccrued rebates(1)\\n\\nAccrued returns\\n\\nAccrued promotions\\n\\nSubtotal\\n\\nReserve for doubtful accounts\\n\\nReserve for cash discounts\\n\\nTotal\\n\\nBalance at\\nBeginning\\nof Period\\n\\nAccruals\\n\\nPayments/\\nCredits(2)\\n\\nBalance at\\nEnd of\\nPeriod\\n\\n$10,331\\n\\n43,026\\n\\n(41,068)\\n\\n12,289\\n\\n520\\n\\n3\\n\\n444\\n\\n5\\n\\n(315)\\n\\n(7)\\n\\n649\\n\\n1\\n\\n$10,854\\n\\n43,475\\n\\n(41,390)\\n\\n12,939\\n\\n50\\n\\n94\\n\\n$10,998\\n\\n0\\n\\n1,281\\n\\n44,756\\n\\n(6)\\n\\n(1,265)\\n\\n(42,661)\\n\\n44\\n\\n110\\n\\n13,093\\n\\n$9,837\\n\\n37,922\\n\\n(37,428)\\n\\n10,331\\n\\n460\\n\\n6\\n\\n345\\n\\n13\\n\\n(285)\\n\\n(16)\\n\\n520\\n\\n3\\n\\n$10,303\\n\\n38,280\\n\\n(37,729)\\n\\n10,854\\n\\n52\\n\\n70\\n\\n$10,425\\n\\n18\\n\\n1,163\\n\\n39,461\\n\\n(20)\\n\\n(1,139)\\n\\n(38,888)\\n\\n50\\n\\n94\\n\\n10,998\\n\\n(1)\\n\\nIncludes reserve for customer rebates of $203 million at January 1, 2023 and $218 million at January 2, 2022, recorded as a contra\\nasset.\\n\\n(2)\\n\\nIncludes prior period adjustments\\n\\nJohnson & Johnson 2022 Annual Report • 37\\n\\n\\x0cMedTech Segment\\n\\n(Dollars in Millions)\\n\\n2022\\n\\nAccrued rebates(1)\\n\\nAccrued returns\\n\\nAccrued promotions\\n\\nSubtotal\\n\\nReserve for doubtful accounts\\n\\nReserve for cash discounts\\n\\nTotal\\n\\n2021\\n\\nAccrued rebates(1)\\n\\nAccrued returns\\n\\nAccrued promotions\\n\\nSubtotal\\n\\nReserve for doubtful accounts\\n\\nReserve for cash discounts\\n\\nTotal\\n\\nBalance at\\nBeginning\\nof Period\\n\\nAccruals\\n\\nPayments/\\nCredits\\n\\nBalance at\\nEnd of\\nPeriod\\n\\n$1,446\\n\\n6,131\\n\\n(6,107)\\n\\n1,470\\n\\n134\\n\\n54\\n\\n531\\n\\n102\\n\\n(531)\\n\\n(113)\\n\\n134\\n\\n43\\n\\n$1,634\\n\\n6,764\\n\\n(6,751)\\n\\n1,647\\n\\n148\\n\\n10\\n\\n6\\n\\n99\\n\\n(29)\\n\\n(100)\\n\\n125\\n\\n9\\n\\n$1,792\\n\\n6,869\\n\\n(6,880)\\n\\n1,781\\n\\n$1,174\\n\\n5,942\\n\\n(5,670)\\n\\n1,446\\n\\n138\\n\\n52\\n\\n559\\n\\n140\\n\\n(563)\\n\\n(138)\\n\\n134\\n\\n54\\n\\n$1,364\\n\\n6,641\\n\\n(6,371)\\n\\n1,634\\n\\n202\\n\\n9\\n\\n12\\n\\n96\\n\\n(66)\\n\\n(95)\\n\\n148\\n\\n10\\n\\n$1,575\\n\\n6,749\\n\\n(6,532)\\n\\n1,792\\n\\n(1)\\n\\nIncludes reserve for customer rebates of $802 million at January 1, 2023 and $845 million at January 2, 2022, recorded as a contra\\nasset.\\n\\nIncome Taxes: Income taxes are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable for the current year and include the\\nresults of any difference between U.S. GAAP accounting and tax reporting, recorded as deferred tax assets or liabilities.\\nThe Company estimates deferred tax assets and liabilities based on enacted tax regulations and rates. Future changes in\\ntax laws and rates may affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities.\\n\\nThe Company has unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions. The Company follows U.S. GAAP, which\\nprescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of\\na tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Management believes that changes in these estimates would\\nnot have a material effect on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows or financial position.\\n\\nThe Company has recorded deferred tax liabilities on all undistributed earnings prior to December 31, 2017 from its\\ninternational subsidiaries. The Company has not provided deferred taxes on the undistributed earnings subsequent to\\nJanuary 1, 2018 from certain international subsidiaries where the earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested. The\\nCompany intends to continue to reinvest these earnings in those international operations. If the Company decides at a\\nlater date to repatriate these earnings to the U.S., the Company would be required to provide for the net tax effects on\\nthese amounts. The Company estimates that the tax effect of this repatriation would be approximately $0.5 billion under\\ncurrently enacted tax laws and regulations and at current currency exchange rates. This amount does not include the\\npossible benefit of U.S. foreign tax credits, which may substantially offset this cost.\\n\\nSee Note 1 and Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding income taxes.\\n\\nLegal and Self Insurance Contingencies: The Company records accruals for various contingencies, including legal\\nproceedings and product liability claims as these arise in the normal course of business. The accruals are based on\\nmanagement’s judgment as to the probability of losses and, where applicable, actuarially determined estimates. The\\nCompany has self insurance through a wholly-owned captive insurance company. In addition to accruals in the self\\ninsurance program, claims that exceed the insurance coverage are accrued when losses are probable and amounts can be\\nreasonably estimated.\\n\\nThe Company follows the provisions of U.S. GAAP when recording litigation related contingencies. A liability is recorded\\nwhen a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated.\\n\\n38 • Johnson & Johnson 2022 Annual Report\\n\\n\\x0cSee Notes 1 and 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding product liability and legal\\nproceedings.\\n\\nLong-Lived and Intangible Assets: The Company assesses changes, both qualitatively and quantitatively, in economic\\nconditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows in evaluating the value of the Company’s\\nproperty, plant and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets. As these assumptions and estimates may change over time,\\nit may or may not be necessary for the Company to record impairment charges.\\n\\nEmployee Benefit Plans: The Company sponsors various retirement and pension plans, including defined benefit,\\ndefined contribution and termination indemnity plans, which cover most employees worldwide. These plans are based on\\nassumptions for the discount rate, expected return on plan assets, mortality rates, expected salary increases, healthcare\\ncost trend rates and attrition rates. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on these\\nrates.\\n\\nStock Based Compensation: The Company recognizes compensation expense associated with the issuance of equity\\ninstruments to employees for their services. Based on the type of equity instrument, the fair value is estimated on the date\\nof grant using either the Black-Scholes option valuation model or a combination of both the Black-Scholes option\\nvaluation model and Monte Carlo valuation model, and is expensed in the financial statements over the service period. The\\ninput assumptions used in determining fair value are the expected life, expected volatility, risk-free rate and expected\\ndividend yield. For performance share units, the fair market value is calculated for the two component goals at the date of\\ngrant: adjusted operational earnings per share and relative total shareholder return. The fair values for the earnings per\\nshare goal of each performance share unit was estimated on the date of grant using the fair market value of the shares at\\nthe time of the award, discounted for dividends, which are not paid on the performance share units during the vesting\\nperiod. The fair value for the relative total shareholder return goal of each performance share unit was estimated on the\\ndate of grant using the Monte Carlo valuation model. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional\\ninformation.\\n\\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\\n\\nRefer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for recently adopted accounting pronouncements and recently\\nissued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted as of January 1, 2023.\\n\\nEconomic and Market Factors\\n\\nThe Company is aware that its products are used in an environment where, for more than a decade, policymakers,\\nconsumers and businesses have expressed concerns about the rising cost of healthcare. In response to these concerns,\\nthe Company has a long-standing policy of pricing products responsibly. For the period 2012 - 2022, in the U.S., the\\nweighted average compound annual growth rate of the Company’s net price increases for healthcare products\\n(prescription and over-the-counter drugs, hospital and professional products) was below the U.S. Consumer Price Index\\n(CPI).\\n\\nThe Company operates in certain countries where the economic conditions continue to present significant challenges. The\\nCompany continues to monitor these situations and take appropriate actions. Inflation rates continue to have an effect on\\nworldwide economies and, consequently, on the way companies operate. The Company has accounted for operations in\\nArgentina and Venezuela as highly inflationary, as the prior three-year cumulative inflation rate surpassed 100%. Beginning\\nin the fiscal second quarter of 2022, the Company accounted for operations in Turkey as highly inflationary, as the prior\\nthree-year cumulative inflation rate surpassed 100%. This did not have a material impact to the Company’s results in the\\nperiod. In the face of increasing costs, the Company strives to maintain its profit margins through cost reduction programs,\\nproductivity improvements and periodic price increases.\\n\\nRussia-Ukraine War\\n\\nAlthough the long-term implications of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine are difficult to predict at this time, the financial impact\\nof the conflict in the fiscal 2022, including accounts receivable or inventory reserves, was not material. As of both the fiscal\\nyears ending January 1, 2023 and January 2, 2022, the business of the Company’s Ukraine subsidiaries represented less\\nthan 1% of the Company’s consolidated assets and revenues. As of both the fiscal years ending January 1, 2023 and\\nJanuary 2, 2022, the business of the Company’s Russian subsidiaries represented less than 1% of the Company’s\\nconsolidated assets and represented 1% of revenues.\\n\\nIn early March, the Company took steps to suspend all advertising, enrollment in clinical trials, and any additional\\ninvestment in Russia. Additionally, at the end of March, the Company made the decision to suspend supply of personal\\n\\nJohnson & Johnson 2022 Annual Report • 39\\n\\n\\x0ccare products in Russia. The Company continues to supply its other products as patients rely on many of the products for\\nhealthcare purposes.\\n\\nThe Company is exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. A 1% change in the value of the U.S. Dollar as\\ncompared to all foreign currencies in which the Company had sales, income or expense in 2022 would have increased or\\ndecreased the translation of foreign sales by approximately $0.5 billion and net income by approximately $0.1 billion.\\n\\nGovernments around the world consider various proposals to make changes to tax laws, which may include increasing or\\ndecreasing existing statutory tax rates. In connection with various government initiatives, companies are required to\\ndisclose more information to tax authorities on operations around the world, which may lead to greater audit scrutiny of\\nprofits earned in other countries. A change in statutory tax rate in any country would result in the revaluation of the\\nCompany’s deferred tax assets and liabilities related to that particular jurisdiction in the period in which the new tax law is\\nenacted. This change would result in an expense or benefit recorded to the Company’s Consolidated Statement of\\nEarnings. The Company closely monitors these proposals as they arise in the countries where it operates. Changes to the\\nstatutory tax rate may occur at any time, and any related expense or benefit recorded may be material to the fiscal quarter\\nand year in which the law change is enacted.\\n\\nThe Company faces various worldwide healthcare changes that may continue to result in pricing pressures that include\\nhealthcare cost containment and government legislation relating to sales, promotions, pricing and reimbursement of\\nhealthcare products.\\n\\nChanges in the behavior and spending patterns of purchasers of healthcare products and services, including delaying\\nmedical procedures, rationing prescription medications, reducing the frequency of physician visits and foregoing\\nhealthcare insurance coverage, as a result of the current global economic downturn, may continue to impact the\\nCompany’s businesses.\\n\\nThe Company also operates in an environment increasingly hostile to intellectual property rights. Firms have filed\\nAbbreviated New Drug Applications or Biosimilar Biological Product Applications with the U.S. FDA or otherwise\\nchallenged the coverage and/or validity of the Company’s patents, seeking to market generic or biosimilar forms of many\\nof the Company’s key pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products. In the\\nevent the Company is not successful in defending the patent claims challenged in the resulting lawsuits, generic or\\nbiosimilar versions of the products at issue will be introduced to the market, resulting in the potential for substantial market\\nshare and revenue losses for those products, and which may result in a non-cash impairment charge in any associated\\nintangible asset. There is also a risk that one or more competitors could launch a generic or biosimilar version of the\\nproduct at issue following regulatory approval even though one or more valid patents are in place.\\n\\nLegal Proceedings\\n\\nJohnson & Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in various lawsuits and claims regarding product liability,\\nintellectual property, commercial, employment, indemnification and other matters; governmental investigations; and other\\nlegal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business.\\n\\nThe Company records accruals for loss contingencies associated with these legal matters when it is probable that a\\nliability will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. As of January 1, 2023, the Company has\\ndetermined that the liabilities associated with certain litigation matters are probable and can be reasonably estimated. The\\nCompany has accrued for these matters and will continue to monitor each related legal issue and adjust accruals as might\\nbe warranted based on new information and further developments in accordance with ASC 450-20-25. For these and\\nother litigation and regulatory matters discussed below for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible, the Company\\nis unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond the amounts accrued. Amounts accrued for legal\\ncontingencies often result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties that rely heavily on\\nestimates and assumptions including timing of related payments. The ability to make such estimates and judgments can be\\naffected by various factors including, among other things, whether damages sought in the proceedings are\\nunsubstantiated or indeterminate; scientific and legal discovery has not commenced or is not complete; proceedings are in\\nearly stages; matters present legal uncertainties; there are significant facts in dispute; procedural or jurisdictional issues;\\nthe uncertainty and unpredictability of the number of potential claims; ability to achieve comprehensive multi-party\\nsettlements; complexity of related cross-claims and counterclaims; and/or there are numerous parties involved. To the\\nextent adverse awards, judgments or verdicts have been rendered against the Company, the Company does not record an\\naccrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be reasonably estimated.\\n\\n40 • Johnson & Johnson 2022 Annual Report\\n\\n\\x0cIn the Company’s opinion, based on its examination of these matters, its experience to date and discussions with counsel,\\nthe ultimate outcome of legal proceedings, net of liabilities accrued in the Company’s balance sheet, is not expected to\\nhave a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position. However, the resolution of, or increase in accruals for,\\none or more of these matters in any reporting period may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of\\noperations and cash flows for that period.\\n\\nSee Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for further information regarding\\nlegal proceedings.\\n\\nCommon Stock\\n\\nThe Company’s Common Stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol JNJ.

TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\n\\n1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\\n\\nPrinciples of Consolidation\\n\\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company).\\nIntercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated. Columns and rows within tables may not add due to rounding.\\nPercentages have been calculated using actual, non-rounded figures.\\n\\nDescription of the Company and Business Segments\\n\\nThe Company has approximately 152,700 employees worldwide engaged in the research and development, manufacture\\nand sale of a broad range of products in the healthcare field. The Company conducts business in virtually all countries of\\nthe world and its primary focus is on products related to human health and well-being.\\n\\nThe Company is organized into three business segments: Consumer Health, Pharmaceutical and MedTech. The\\nConsumer Health segment includes a broad range of products used in the Baby Care, Oral Care, Skin Health/Beauty,\\nOver-the-Counter pharmaceutical, Women’s Health and Wound Care markets. These products are marketed to the\\ngeneral public and sold online (eCommerce) and to retail outlets and distributors throughout the world. The\\nPharmaceutical segment is focused on the following therapeutic areas, including Immunology, Infectious diseases,\\nNeuroscience, Oncology, Pulmonary Hypertension, and Cardiovascular and Metabolic diseases. Products in this segment\\nare distributed directly to retailers, wholesalers, distributors, hospitals and healthcare professionals for prescription use.\\nThe MedTech segment includes a broad portfolio of products used in the Orthopaedic, Surgery, Interventional Solutions\\n(cardiovascular and neurovascular) and Vision fields. These products are distributed to wholesalers, hospitals and retailers,\\nand used principally in the professional fields by physicians, nurses, hospitals, eye care professionals and clinics.\\n\\nIn November 2021, the Company announced its intention to separate the Company’s Consumer Health business (Kenvue\\nas the name for the planned New Consumer Health Company), with the intention to create a new, publicly traded\\ncompany by the end of the fiscal year 2023.\\n\\nNew Accounting Standards\\nRecently Adopted Accounting Standards\\n\\nThere were no new material accounting standards adopted in fiscal 2022.\\n\\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\\nNot Adopted as of January 1, 2023\\n\\nASU 2022-04: Liabilities-Supplier Finance Programs (Topic 405-50) – Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program\\nObligations\\nThis update requires that a buyer in a supplier finance program disclose additional information about the program to allow\\nfinancial statement users to better understand the effect of the programs on an entity’s working capital, liquidity, and cash\\nflows. This update will be effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, except for the\\namendment on roll forward information, which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023. Early\\nadoption is permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact of this update on its disclosures and will adopt this\\nstandard in the fiscal first quarter of 2023.\\n\\nCash Equivalents\\n\\nThe Company classifies all highly liquid investments with stated maturities of three months or less from date of purchase\\nas cash equivalents and all highly liquid investments with stated maturities of greater than three months from the date of\\npurchase as current marketable securities. The Company has a policy of making investments only with commercial\\ninstitutions that have at least an investment grade credit rating. The Company invests its cash primarily in government\\nsecurities and obligations, corporate debt securities, money market funds and reverse repurchase agreements (RRAs).\\n\\nRRAs are collateralized by deposits in the form of Government Securities and Obligations for an amount not less than\\n102% of their value. The Company does not record an asset or liability as the Company is not permitted to sell or\\n\\nJohnson & Johnson 2022 Annual Report • 47\\n\\n\\x0crepledge the associated collateral. The Company has a policy that the collateral has at least an A (or equivalent) credit\\nrating. The Company utilizes a third party custodian to manage the exchange of funds and ensure that collateral received is\\nmaintained at 102% of the value of the RRAs on a daily basis. RRAs with stated maturities of greater than three months\\nfrom the date of purchase are classified as marketable securities.\\n\\nInvestments\\n\\nInvestments classified as held to maturity investments are reported at amortized cost and realized gains or losses are\\nreported in earnings. Investments classified as available-for-sale debt securities are carried at estimated fair value with\\nunrealized gains and losses recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Available-for-sale\\nsecurities available for current operations are classified as current assets otherwise, they are classified as long term.\\nManagement determines the appropriate classification of its investment in debt and equity securities at the time of\\npurchase and re-evaluates such determination at each balance sheet date. The Company reviews its investments for\\nimpairment and adjusts these investments to fair value through earnings, as required.\\n\\nProperty, Plant and Equipment and Depreciation\\n\\nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at cost. The Company utilizes the straight-line method of depreciation over the\\nestimated useful lives of the assets:\\n\\nBuilding and building equipment\\n\\nLand and leasehold improvements\\n\\nMachinery and equipment\\n\\n30 years\\n\\n10 - 20 years\\n\\n2 - 13 years\\n\\nThe Company capitalizes certain computer software and development costs, included in machinery and equipment, when\\nincurred in connection with developing or obtaining computer software for internal use. Capitalized software costs are\\namortized over the estimated useful lives of the software, which generally range from 3 to 8 years.\\n\\nThe Company reviews long-lived assets to assess recoverability using undiscounted cash flows. When certain events or\\nchanges in operating or economic conditions occur, an impairment assessment may be performed on the recoverability of\\nthe carrying value of these assets. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured based on the difference\\nbetween the asset’s fair value and its carrying value. If quoted market prices are not available, the Company will estimate\\nfair value using a discounted value of estimated future cash flows.\\n\\nRevenue Recognition\\n\\nThe Company recognizes revenue from product sales when obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer\\nare satisfied; generally, this occurs with the transfer of control of the goods to customers. The Company’s global payment\\nterms are typically between 30 to 90 days. Provisions for certain rebates, sales incentives, trade promotions, coupons,\\nproduct returns, discounts to customers and governmental clawback provisions are accounted for as variable\\nconsideration and recorded as a reduction in sales. The liability is recognized within Accrued Rebates, Returns, and\\nPromotions on the consolidated balance sheet.\\n\\nProduct discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct, indirect and other market participants, as\\nwell as market conditions, including consideration of competitor pricing. Rebates are estimated based on contractual\\nterms, historical experience, patient outcomes, trend analysis and projected market conditions in the various markets\\nserved. A significant portion of the liability related to rebates is from the sale of the Company’s pharmaceutical products\\nwithin the U.S., primarily the Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid programs, which amounted to $9.6 billion and\\n$7.7 billion as of January 1, 2023 and January 2, 2022, respectively. The Company evaluates market conditions for\\nproducts or groups of products primarily through the analysis of wholesaler and other third-party sell-through and market\\nresearch data, as well as internally generated information.\\n\\nSales returns are estimated and recorded based on historical sales and returns information. Products that exhibit unusual\\nsales or return patterns due to dating, competition or other marketing matters are specifically investigated and analyzed as\\npart of the accounting for sales return accruals.\\n\\n48 • Johnson & Johnson 2022 Annual Report\\n\\n\\x0cSales returns allowances represent a reserve for products that may be returned due to expiration, destruction in the field,\\nor in specific areas, product recall. The sales returns reserve is based on historical return trends by product and by market\\nas a percent to gross sales. In accordance with the Company’s accounting policies, the Company generally issues credit\\nto customers for returned goods. The Company’s sales returns reserves are accounted for in accordance with the\\nU.S. GAAP guidance for revenue recognition when right of return exists. Sales returns reserves are recorded at full sales\\nvalue. Sales returns in the Consumer Health and Pharmaceutical segments are almost exclusively not resalable. Sales\\nreturns for certain franchises in the MedTech segment are typically resalable but are not material. The Company\\ninfrequently exchanges products from inventory for returned products. The sales returns reserve for the total Company has\\nbeen approximately 1.0% of annual net trade sales during each of the fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020.\\n\\nPromotional programs, such as product listing allowances and cooperative advertising arrangements, are recorded in the\\nsame period as related sales. Continuing promotional programs include coupons and volume-based sales incentive\\nprograms. The redemption cost of consumer coupons is based on historical redemption experience by product and value.\\nVolume-based incentive programs are based on the estimated sales volumes for the incentive period and are recorded as\\nproducts are sold. These arrangements are evaluated to determine the appropriate amounts to be deferred or recorded as\\na reduction of revenue. The Company also earns profit-share payments through collaborative arrangements for certain\\nproducts, which are included in sales to customers. Profit-share payments were less than 2.0% of the total revenues in\\nfiscal year 2022 and less than 3.0% of the total revenues in fiscal years 2021 and 2020 and are included in sales to\\ncustomers.\\n\\nSee Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further disaggregation of revenue.\\n\\nShipping and Handling\\n\\nShipping and handling costs incurred were $1.1 billion, $1.1 billion and $1.0 billion in fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020,\\nrespectively, and are included in selling, marketing and administrative expense. The amount of revenue received for\\nshipping and handling is less than 1.0% of sales to customers for all periods presented.\\n\\nInventories\\n\\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value determined by the first-in, first-out method.\\n\\nIntangible Assets and Goodwill\\n\\nThe authoritative literature on U.S. GAAP requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives be assessed\\nannually for impairment. The Company completed its annual impairment test for 2022 in the fiscal fourth quarter. Future\\nimpairment tests will be performed annually in the fiscal fourth quarter, or sooner if warranted. Purchased in-process\\nresearch and development is accounted for as an indefinite lived intangible asset until the underlying project is completed,\\nat which point the intangible asset will be accounted for as a definite lived intangible asset. If warranted the purchased in-\\nprocess research and development could be written off or partially impaired depending on the underlying program.\\n\\nIntangible assets that have finite useful lives continue to be amortized over their useful lives, and are reviewed for\\nimpairment when warranted by economic conditions. See Note 5 for further details on Intangible Assets and Goodwill.\\n\\nFinancial Instruments\\n\\nAs required by U.S. GAAP, all derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Fair value is the exit\\nprice that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability. Fair value is a market-based measurement\\ndetermined using assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. The authoritative literature\\nestablishes a three-level hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in measuring fair value, with Level 1 having the highest\\npriority and Level 3 having the lowest. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings\\nor other comprehensive income, depending on whether the derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction, and if\\nso, the type of hedge transaction.\\n\\nThe Company documents all relationships between hedged items and derivatives. The overall risk management strategy\\nincludes reasons for undertaking hedge transactions and entering into derivatives. The objectives of this strategy are:\\n(1) minimize foreign currency exposure’s impact on the Company’s financial performance; (2) protect the Company’s cash\\n\\nJohnson & Johnson 2022 Annual Report • 49\\n\\n\\x0cflow from adverse movements in foreign exchange rates; (3) ensure the appropriateness of financial instruments; and\\n(4) manage the enterprise risk associated with financial institutions. See Note 6 for additional information on Financial\\nInstruments.\\n\\nLeases\\n\\nThe Company determines whether an arrangement is a lease at contract inception by establishing if the contract conveys\\nthe right to control the use of identified property, plant, or equipment for a period of time in exchange for consideration.\\nRight of Use (ROU) Assets and Lease Liabilities for operating leases are included in Other assets, Accrued liabilities, and\\nOther liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. The ROU Assets represent the right to use an underlying asset for the\\nlease term and lease liabilities represent an obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Commitments under\\nfinance leases are not significant, and are included in Property, plant and equipment, Loans and notes payable, and Long-\\nterm debt on the consolidated balance sheet.\\n\\nROU Assets and Lease Liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of all\\nminimum lease payments over the lease term. The Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information\\navailable at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments, when the implicit rate is not readily\\ndeterminable. Lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease. These options are included in the lease\\nterm when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. Operating lease expense is recognized on a\\nstraight-line basis over the lease term. The Company has elected the following policy elections on adoption: use of\\nportfolio approach on leases of assets under master service agreements, exclusion of short term leases on the balance\\nsheet, and not separating lease and non-lease components.\\n\\nThe Company primarily has operating lease for space, vehicles, manufacturing equipment and data processing equipment.\\nThe ROU asset pertaining to operating leases was $1.1 billion and $0.9 billion in fiscal years 2022 and 2021,\\nrespectively. The lease liability was $1.3 billion and $1.0 billion in fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. The operating\\nlease costs were $0.3 billion in fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Cash paid for amounts included in the\\nmeasurement of lease liabilities were $0.3 billion in fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\\n\\nProduct Liability\\n\\nAccruals for product liability claims are recorded, on an undiscounted basis, when it is probable that a liability has been\\nincurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on existing information and actuarially\\ndetermined estimates where applicable. The accruals are adjusted periodically as additional information becomes\\navailable. The Company accrues an estimate of the legal defense costs needed to defend each matter when those costs\\nare probable and can be reasonably estimated. To the extent adverse verdicts have been rendered against the Company,\\nthe Company does not record an accrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be reasonably estimated.\\n\\nThe Company has self insurance through a wholly-owned captive insurance company. In addition to accruals in the self\\ninsurance program, claims that exceed the insurance coverage are accrued when losses are probable and amounts can be\\nreasonably estimated.\\n\\nResearch and Development\\n\\nResearch and development expenses are expensed as incurred in accordance with ASC 730, Research and\\nDevelopment. Upfront and milestone payments made to third parties in connection with research and development\\ncollaborations are expensed as incurred up to the point of regulatory approval. Payments made to third parties subsequent\\nto regulatory approval are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life of the related product. Amounts\\ncapitalized for such payments are included in other intangibles, net of accumulated amortization.\\n\\nThe Company enters into collaborative arrangements, typically with other pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies, to\\ndevelop and commercialize drug candidates or intellectual property. These arrangements typically involve two (or more)\\nparties who are active participants in the collaboration and are exposed to significant risks and rewards dependent on the\\ncommercial success of the activities. These collaborations usually involve various activities by one or more parties,\\nincluding research and development, marketing and selling and distribution. Often, these collaborations require upfront,\\nmilestone and royalty or profit share payments, contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events linked to the\\nsuccess of the asset in development. Amounts due from collaborative partners related to development activities are\\ngenerally reflected as a reduction of research and development expense because the performance of contract\\n\\n50 • Johnson & Johnson 2022 Annual Report\\n\\n\\x0cdevelopment services is not central to the Company’s operations. In general, the income statement presentation for these\\ncollaborations is as follows:\\n\\nNature/Type of Collaboration\\n\\nStatement of Earnings Presentation\\n\\nThird-party sale of product & profit share payments received\\n\\nSales to customers\\n\\nRoyalties/milestones paid to collaborative partner (post-\\nregulatory approval)*\\n\\nCost of products sold\\n\\nRoyalties received from collaborative partner\\n\\nOther income (expense), net\\n\\nUpfront payments & milestones paid to collaborative partner\\n(pre-regulatory approval)\\n\\nResearch and development expense\\n\\nResearch and development payments to collaborative\\npartner\\n\\nResearch and development payments received from\\ncollaborative partner or government entity\\n\\nResearch and development expense\\n\\nReduction of Research and development expense\\n\\n* Milestones are capitalized as intangible assets and amortized to cost of products sold over the useful life.\\n\\nFor all years presented, there was no individual project that represented greater than 5% of the total annual consolidated\\nresearch and development expense.\\n\\nThe Company has a number of products and compounds developed in collaboration with strategic partners including\\nXARELTO, co-developed with Bayer HealthCare AG and IMBRUVICA, developed in collaboration and co-marketed with\\nPharmacyclics LLC, an AbbVie company.\\n\\nSeparately, the Company has a number of licensing arrangements for products and compounds including DARZALEX,\\nlicensed from Genmab A/S.\\n\\nAdvertising\\n\\nCosts associated with advertising are expensed in the year incurred and are included in selling, marketing and\\nadministrative expenses. Advertising expenses worldwide, which comprised television, radio, print media and Internet\\nadvertising, were $2.1 billion, $2.7 billion and $2.1 billion in fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\\n\\nIncome Taxes\\n\\nIncome taxes are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable for the current year and include the results of any\\ndifference between U.S. GAAP accounting and tax reporting, recorded as deferred tax assets or liabilities. The Company\\nestimates deferred tax assets and liabilities based on enacted tax regulations and rates. Future changes in tax laws and\\nrates may affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future.\\n\\nThe Company has unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions. The Company follows U.S. GAAP which\\nprescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of\\na tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Management believes that changes in these estimates would\\nnot have a material effect on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows or financial position.\\n\\nIn 2017, the United States enacted into law new U.S. tax legislation, the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). This law\\nincluded provisions for a comprehensive overhaul of the corporate income tax code, including a reduction of the statutory\\ncorporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective on January 1, 2018. The TCJA included a provision for a tax on all\\npreviously undistributed earnings of U.S. companies located in foreign jurisdictions. Undistributed earnings in the form of\\ncash and cash equivalents were taxed at a rate of 15.5% and all other earnings were taxed at a rate of 8.0%. This tax is\\npayable over 8 years and will not accrue interest. These payments began in 2018 and will continue through 2025. The\\nremaining balance at the end of the 2022 was approximately $6.1 billion, of which $4.6 billion is classified as noncurrent\\nand reflected as “Long-term taxes payable” on the Company’s balance sheet. The balance of this account is related to\\nreceivables from tax authorities not expected to be received in the next 12 months.\\n\\nThe TCJA also includes provisions for a tax on global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI). GILTI is described as the\\nexcess of a U.S. shareholder’s total net foreign income over a deemed return on tangible assets, as provided by the TCJA.\\n\\nJohnson & Johnson 2022 Annual Report • 51\\n\\n\\x0cIn January 2018, the FASB issued guidance that allows companies to elect as an accounting policy whether to record the\\ntax effects of GILTI in the period the tax liability is generated (i.e., “period cost”) or provide for deferred tax assets and\\nliabilities related to basis differences that exist and are expected to effect the amount of GILTI inclusion in future years\\nupon reversal (i.e., “deferred method”). The Company has elected to account for GILTI under the deferred method. The\\ndeferred tax amounts recorded are based on the evaluation of temporary differences that are expected to reverse as GILTI\\nis incurred in future periods.\\n\\nThe Company has recorded deferred tax liabilities on all undistributed earnings prior to December 31, 2017 from its\\ninternational subsidiaries. The Company has not provided deferred taxes on the undistributed earnings subsequent to\\nJanuary 1, 2018 from certain international subsidiaries where the earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested. The\\nCompany intends to continue to reinvest these earnings in those international operations. If the Company decides at a\\nlater date to repatriate these earnings to the U.S., the Company would be required to provide for the net tax effects on\\nthese amounts. The Company estimates that the tax effect of this repatriation would be approximately $0.5 billion under\\ncurrently enacted tax laws and regulations and at current currency exchange rates. This amount does not include the\\npossible benefit of U.S. foreign tax credits, which may substantially offset this cost.\\n\\nSee Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding income taxes.\\n\\nNet Earnings Per Share\\n\\nBasic earnings per share is computed by dividing net earnings available to common shareholders by the weighted average\\nnumber of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could\\noccur if securities were exercised or converted into common stock using the treasury stock method.\\n\\nUse of Estimates\\n\\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the\\nU.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Estimates are used when\\naccounting for sales discounts, rebates, allowances and incentives, product liabilities, income taxes, withholding taxes,\\ndepreciation, amortization, employee benefits, contingencies and intangible asset and liability valuations. Actual results\\nmay or may not differ from those estimates.\\n\\nThe Company follows the provisions of U.S. GAAP when recording litigation related contingencies. A liability is recorded\\nwhen a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. The best estimate of a loss within a range is accrued; however,\\nif no estimate in the range is better than any other, the minimum amount is accrued.\\n\\nAnnual Closing Date\\n\\nThe Company follows the concept of a fiscal year, which ends on the Sunday nearest to the end of the month of\\nDecember. Normally each fiscal year consists of 52 weeks, but every five or six years the fiscal year consists of 53 weeks,\\nand therefore includes additional shipping days, as was the case in fiscal year 2020, and will be the case again in fiscal\\nyear 2026.\\n\\nReclassification\\n\\nCertain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation.\\n\\n52 • Johnson & Johnson 2022 Annual Report\\n\\n\\x0c2.

Additional information regarding efficacy of the AD and HS indications became available which led the Company to the\\ndecision to terminate the development of bermekimab for AD and HS.

Fair Value Measurements\\n\\nThe Company uses forward foreign exchange contracts to manage its exposure to the variability of cash flows, primarily\\nrelated to the foreign exchange rate changes of future intercompany products and third-party purchases of materials\\ndenominated in a foreign currency. The Company uses cross currency interest rate swaps to manage currency risk\\nprimarily related to borrowings. Both types of derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges.\\n\\nAdditionally, the Company primarily uses interest rate swaps as an instrument to manage interest rate risk related to fixed\\nrate borrowings. These derivatives are designated as fair value hedges. The Company uses cross currency interest rate\\nswaps and forward foreign exchange contracts designated as net investment hedges. Additionally, the Company uses\\nforward foreign exchange contracts to offset its exposure to certain foreign currency assets and liabilities. These forward\\nforeign exchange contracts are not designated as hedges and therefore, changes in the fair values of these derivatives are\\nrecognized in earnings, thereby offsetting the current earnings effect of the related foreign currency assets and liabilities.\\n\\nIn the fiscal fourth quarter of 2022, the Company entered into forward starting interest rate swaps with notional amounts\\ntotaling $2.4 billion in contemplation of hedging interest rate risk associated with long-term financing for the Consumer\\nHealth segment separation. These forward starting interest rate swaps are not designated as hedges and therefore,\\nchanges in the fair values of these derivatives are recognized in earnings. At the end of the fiscal year 2022, the changes\\nin fair value was not material and therefore not included in the table below.\\n\\nThe Company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes, or that contain credit\\nrisk related contingent features. The Company maintains credit support agreements (CSA) with certain derivative\\ncounterparties establishing collateral thresholds based on respective credit ratings and netting agreements. As of\\nJanuary 1, 2023, the total amount of cash collateral paid by the Company under the CSA amounted to $0.8 billion net,\\nrelated to net investment and cash flow hedges. On an ongoing basis, the Company monitors counter-party credit ratings.\\nThe Company considers credit non-performance risk to be low, because the Company primarily enters into agreements\\nwith commercial institutions that have at least an investment grade credit rating. Refer to the table on significant financial\\nassets and liabilities measured at fair value contained in this footnote for receivables and payables with these commercial\\ninstitutions. As of January 1, 2023, the Company had notional amounts outstanding for forward foreign exchange\\ncontracts, cross currency interest rate swaps and interest rate swaps of $43.3 billion, $36.2 billion and $12.4 billion,\\nrespectively. As of January 2, 2022, the Company had notional amounts outstanding for forward foreign exchange\\ncontracts, cross currency interest rate swaps and interest rate swaps of $45.8 billion, $37.4 billion and $10.0 billion,\\nrespectively.\\n\\nAll derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are\\nrecorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on whether the derivative is\\ndesignated as part of a hedge transaction, and if so, the type of hedge transaction.\\n\\nThe designation as a cash flow hedge is made at the entrance date of the derivative contract. At inception, all derivatives\\nare expected to be highly effective. Foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges are accounted for under\\nthe forward method and all gains/losses associated with these contracts will be recognized in the income statement when\\nthe hedged item impacts earnings. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in accumulated other\\ncomprehensive income until the underlying transaction affects earnings, and are then reclassified to earnings in the same\\naccount as the hedged transaction.\\n\\nGains and losses associated with interest rate swaps and changes in fair value of hedged debt attributable to changes in\\ninterest rates are recorded to interest expense in the period in which they occur. Gains and losses on net investment\\nhedges are accounted through the currency translation account within accumulated other comprehensive income. The\\nportion excluded from effectiveness testing is recorded through interest (income) expense using the spot method. On an\\nongoing basis, the Company assesses whether each derivative continues to be highly effective in offsetting changes of\\nhedged items. If and when a derivative is no longer expected to be highly effective, hedge accounting is discontinued.\\n\\n56 • Johnson & Johnson 2022 Annual Report\\n\\n\\x0cThe Company designated its Euro denominated notes issued in May 2016 with due dates ranging from 2022 to 2035 as\\na net investment hedge of the Company’s investments in certain of its international subsidiaries that use the Euro as their\\nfunctional currency in order to reduce the volatility caused by changes in exchange rates.\\n\\nAs of January 1, 2023, the balance of deferred net loss on derivatives included in accumulated other comprehensive\\nincome was $230 million after-tax. For additional information, see the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income\\nand Note 13. The Company expects that substantially all of the amounts related to forward foreign exchange contracts will\\nbe reclassified into earnings over the next 12 months as a result of transactions that are expected to occur over that\\nperiod.

There were offsetting impacts of $142 million and $422 million, respectively, of changes in the fair value\\nreflected in net income due to changes in observable prices and gains on the disposal of investments. The impact in fiscal\\nyear 2021, was driven by the gain on disposal of the Grail investment. In fiscal year 2022, the Company sold all of its\\nequity investments in argenx SE for proceeds of $0.6 billion.\\n\\nFair value is the exit price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability. Fair value is a market-based\\nmeasurement determined using assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. In\\naccordance with ASC 820, a three-level hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in measuring fair value. The levels within the\\nhierarchy are described below with Level 1 having the highest priority and Level 3 having the lowest.\\n\\nThe fair value of a derivative financial instrument (i.e., forward foreign exchange contracts, interest rate contracts) is the\\naggregation by currency of all future cash flows discounted to its present value at the prevailing market interest rates and\\nsubsequently converted to the U.S. Dollar at the current spot foreign exchange rate. The Company does not believe that\\nfair values of these derivative instruments materially differ from the amounts that could be realized upon settlement or\\nmaturity, or that the changes in fair value will have a material effect on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows or\\nfinancial position. The Company also holds equity investments which are classified as Level 1 and debt securities which\\nare classified as Level 2. The Company holds acquisition related contingent liabilities based upon certain regulatory and\\ncommercial events, which are classified as Level 3, whose values are determined using discounted cash flow\\nmethodologies or similar techniques for which the determination of fair value requires significant judgment or estimations.\\n\\nThe following three levels of inputs are used to measure fair value:\\n\\nLevel 1 — Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.\\n\\nLevel 2 — Significant other observable inputs.\\n\\nLevel 3 — Significant unobservable inputs.\\n\\nThe Company’s significant financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value as of the fiscal year ended January 1, 2023\\nand January 2, 2022 were as follows:\\n\\n(Dollars in Millions)\\n\\nLevel 1\\n\\nLevel 2\\n\\nLevel 3\\n\\nTotal\\n\\nTotal(1)\\n\\n2022\\n\\n2021\\n\\nDerivatives designated as hedging instruments:\\n\\nAssets:\\n\\nForward foreign exchange contracts\\n\\nInterest rate contracts(2)\\n\\nTotal\\n\\nLiabilities:\\n\\nForward foreign exchange contracts\\n\\nInterest rate contracts(2)\\n\\nTotal\\n\\nDerivatives not designated as hedging instruments:\\n\\nAssets:\\n\\nForward foreign exchange contracts\\n\\nLiabilities:\\n\\nForward foreign exchange contracts\\n\\nAvailable For Sale Other Investments:\\n\\nEquity investments(3)\\n\\nDebt securities(4)\\n\\nOther Liabilities\\n\\n$ —\\n\\n—\\n\\n$ —\\n\\n—\\n\\n—\\n\\n$ —\\n\\n$ —\\n\\n—\\n\\n576\\n\\n—\\n\\n629\\n\\n1,534\\n\\n2,163\\n\\n511\\n\\n2,778\\n\\n3,289\\n\\n38\\n\\n68\\n\\n—\\n\\n10,487\\n\\n—\\n\\n—\\n\\n—\\n\\n—\\n\\n—\\n\\n—\\n\\n—\\n\\n—\\n\\n—\\n\\n—\\n\\n629\\n\\n1,534\\n\\n2,163\\n\\n511\\n\\n2,778\\n\\n3,289\\n\\n38\\n\\n68\\n\\n540\\n\\n796\\n\\n1,336\\n\\n881\\n\\n979\\n\\n1,860\\n\\n24\\n\\n28\\n\\n576\\n\\n1,884\\n\\n10,487\\n\\n19,727\\n\\nContingent Consideration(5)\\n\\n$\\n\\n1,120\\n\\n1,120\\n\\n533\\n\\nJohnson & Johnson 2022 Annual Report • 59\\n\\n\\x0cGross to Net Derivative Reconciliation\\n\\n(Dollars in Millions)\\n\\nTotal Gross Assets\\n\\nCredit Support Agreement (CSA)\\n\\nTotal Net Asset\\n\\nTotal Gross Liabilities\\n\\nCredit Support Agreement (CSA)\\n\\nTotal Net Liabilities\\n\\nSummarized information about changes in liabilities for contingent consideration is as follows:\\n\\n(Dollars in Millions)\\n\\nBeginning Balance\\n\\nChanges in estimated fair value(6)\\n\\nAdditions(7)\\n\\nPayments\\n\\nEnding Balance\\n\\n2022\\n\\n$2,201\\n\\n2021\\n\\n1,360\\n\\n(2,176)\\n\\n(1,285)\\n\\n25\\n\\n75\\n\\n3,357\\n\\n1,888\\n\\n(3,023)\\n\\n(1,855)\\n\\n$334\\n\\n33\\n\\n2022\\n\\n$533\\n\\n2021\\n\\n633\\n\\n2020\\n\\n1,715\\n\\n(194)\\n\\n(52)\\n\\n(1,089)\\n\\n792\\n\\n(11)\\n\\n$1,120\\n\\n—\\n\\n(48)\\n\\n533\\n\\n106\\n\\n(99)\\n\\n633\\n\\n(1)\\n\\n2021 assets and liabilities are all classified as Level 2 with the exception of equity investments of $1,884 million, which are classified\\nas Level 1 and contingent consideration of $533 million, classified as Level 3.\\n\\n(2)\\n\\nIncludes cross currency interest rate swaps and interest rate swaps.\\n\\n(3) Classified as non-current other assets.\\n\\n(4) Classified as cash equivalents and current marketable securities.\\n\\n(5)\\n\\nIncludes $1,116 million, $520 million and $594 million, classified as non-current other liabilities as of January 1, 2023, January 2,\\n2022 and January 3, 2021, respectively.

The net impact of this restructuring was approximately $0.6 billion net\\nbenefit or 2.7% benefit to the Company’s annual effective tax rate, comprised of the following items:\\n\\n• approximately $2.3 billion of local deferred tax assets to record the remeasurement of the tax basis of these assets to\\n\\nfair value, this benefit has been reflected as “International Operations” on the Company’s effective tax rate reconciliation.\\n\\n• approximately $1.7 billion of U.S. deferred tax expense relating to the GILTI deferred tax liability resulting from the\\n\\nremeasurement of these deferred tax assets. This expense has been reflected as “U.S. tax on international income” on\\nthe Company’s effective tax rate reconciliation.\\n\\nAlso, in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2021, the Company recognized a loss on certain U.S. affiliates related to the previously\\nimpaired book value of certain intangibles, which reduced the 2021 tax rate by approximately 1.3% which is reflected as a\\n\\nJohnson & Johnson 2022 Annual Report • 63\\n\\n\\x0c“Tax benefits from loss on capital assets” on the effective tax rate reconciliation. Additionally other fiscal 2021 impacts to\\nthe rate were primarily driven by litigation and acquisition related items as follows:\\n\\n• the Company accrued additional legal expenses, of approximately $1.6 billion for talc at an effective tax rate of 23.5%\\n\\nand $0.8 billion for Risperdal Gynecomastia settlements at an effective tax rate of 16.4% (See Note 19 to the\\nConsolidated Financial Statements for more details).\\n\\n• the Company recorded a partial IPR&D charge of $0.9 billion for the Ottava intangible asset (acquired with the Auris\\n\\nHealth acquisition in 2019) at an effective rate of 22.4%.\\n\\nIn fiscal year 2019, Switzerland enacted the Federal Act on Tax Reform and AHV Financing (TRAF) and became effective\\nfor fiscal year 2020. The Federal transitional provisions of TRAF allow companies, under certain conditions, to adjust the\\ntax basis in certain assets to fair value (i.e., “step-up”) to be depreciated and amortized resulting in an incremental Swiss\\ntax deduction over the transitional period.\\n\\nTRAF also provides for parameters which enable the Swiss cantons to establish localized tax rates and regulations for\\ncompanies. The new cantonal tax parameters include favorable tax benefits for patents and additional research and\\ndevelopment tax deductions. The cantonal transitional provisions of TRAF allowed companies to elect either 1) tax basis\\nstep-up similar to the Federal transition benefit or 2) alternative statutory tax rate for a period not to exceed 5 years. The\\nCompany has operations located in various Swiss cantons.\\n\\nDuring the fiscal year 2020, the final canton where the Company maintains significant operations enacted TRAF\\nlegislation. Additionally, the Company received rulings from the Swiss Federal and cantonal tax authorities in the remaining\\njurisdictions where it has significant operations. These rulings resulted in the Company revising its estimate on the tax\\nbasis adjustment (i.e., “step-up”) for its assets and as a result, the Company recorded additional deferred tax benefits in\\n2020. The Company recognized a net benefit in the fiscal year 2020 for Swiss Tax Reform of approximately $0.4 billion or\\n2.6% benefit to the Company’s annual effective tax rate, comprised of the following items:\\n\\n• approximately $0.3 billion tax benefit relating to the remeasurement of Swiss deferred tax assets and liabilities for the\\nchange in the Federal and cantonal tax rates, where enactment occurred in the fiscal year 2020; this benefit has been\\nreflected as “International Operations” on the Company’s effective tax rate reconciliation.\\n\\n• a $450 million deferred tax asset related to the estimated value of a Federal tax basis step-up of the Company’s Swiss\\n\\nsubsidiaries’ assets as described above; this benefit has been reflected as “International Operations” on the Company’s\\neffective tax rate reconciliation.\\n\\n• approximately $0.3 billion of U.S. deferred tax expense relating to the GILTI deferred tax liability resulting from the\\n\\nremeasurement of the Swiss deferred tax assets and liabilities in the fiscal year 2020. This benefit has been reflected as\\n“U.S. tax on international income” on the Company’s effective tax rate reconciliation.\\n\\nThe Company does not expect to receive future rulings regarding the transitional provisions of TRAF.\\n\\nAlso, in the fiscal year 2020, the Company recognized a capital loss on certain U.S. affiliates related to the previously\\nimpaired book value of certain intangibles, which reduced the 2020 tax rate by approximately 1.2% which is reflected as a\\n“Tax benefits from loss on capital assets” on the effective tax rate reconciliation. In addition, in the fiscal year 2020, the\\nCompany had lower income in higher tax jurisdictions, primarily driven by:\\n\\n• the impact of the accrual of litigation costs related to talc for $4.0 billion which reduced the U.S. earnings before taxes\\n\\nat an effective tax rate of 23.5%;\\n\\n• the accrual of additional legal costs, including an additional $1.0 billion associated with a revised agreement in principle\\n\\nto settle opioid litigation at an effective tax rate of 21.4%\\n\\nThe Company also reduced the contingent consideration liability related to the Auris Health acquisition in 2019 and\\nreversed some of its unrecognized tax benefits due to the completion of several years of tax examinations in certain\\njurisdictions during the fiscal year 2020.\\n\\n64 • Johnson & Johnson 2022 Annual Report\\n\\n\\x0cTemporary differences and carryforwards at the end of fiscal years 2022 and 2021 were as follows:\\n\\n(Dollars in Millions)\\n\\nEmployee related obligations\\n\\nStock based compensation\\n\\nDepreciation of property, plant and equipment\\n\\nGoodwill and intangibles\\n\\nR&D capitalized for tax\\n\\nReserves & liabilities\\n\\nIncome reported for tax purposes\\n\\nNet realizable operating loss carryforwards(4)\\n\\nUndistributed foreign earnings\\n\\nGlobal intangible low-taxed income\\n\\nMiscellaneous international\\n\\nMiscellaneous U.S.\\n\\nTotal deferred income taxes\\n\\n2022\\nDeferred Tax\\n\\n2021\\nDeferred Tax(1)\\n\\nAsset\\n\\nLiability\\n\\nAsset\\n\\nLiability\\n\\n$725\\n\\n687\\n\\n2,611\\n\\n2,761\\n\\n2,045\\n\\n1,260\\n\\n1,565\\n\\n1,053\\n\\n476\\n\\n1,244\\n\\n679\\n\\n1,664\\n\\n2,882\\n\\n2,566\\n\\n1,720\\n\\n1,015\\n\\n(858)\\n\\n(4,271)(3)\\n\\n(1,693)\\n\\n(3,547)\\n\\n(65)\\n\\n870\\n\\n(876)\\n\\n(2,659)(2)\\n\\n(1,461)\\n\\n(4,853)\\n\\n(39)\\n\\n(16)\\n\\n$13,183\\n\\n(10,434)\\n\\n12,640\\n\\n(9,904)\\n\\n(1) Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation.\\n\\n(2) Amount is inclusive of the $2.3 billion deferred tax asset established as part of the reorganized ownership structure of\\n\\ncertain wholly-owned international subsidiaries, as previously described.\\n\\n(3) Amount is inclusive of the $1.8 billion deferred tax liability due to the acquisition of Abiomed.\\n\\n(4) Net of valuation allowances of $0.9 billion in both 2022 and 2021.\\n\\nThe Company has wholly-owned international subsidiaries that have cumulative net losses.

U.S. pension benefits for employees hired after 2014, are calculated using a different formula based on employee\\ncompensation over total years of service (the Retirement Value formula).\\n\\nIn January 2021, the Company announced that, effective on January 1, 2026, all eligible U.S. non-union employees,\\nregardless of hire date, will earn benefits under the Retirement Value formula.

Fair value is based upon quoted\\nmarket prices, where available. If listed prices or quotes are not available, fair value is based upon models that primarily\\nuse, as inputs, market-based or independently sourced market parameters, including yield curves, interest rates, volatilities,\\nequity or debt prices, foreign exchange rates and credit curves.\\n\\nWhile the Plan believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of\\ndifferent methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different\\nestimate of fair value at the reporting date.\\n\\nValuation Hierarchy\\n\\nThe authoritative literature establishes a three-level hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in measuring fair value. The levels\\nwithin the hierarchy are described in the table below with Level 1 having the highest priority and Level 3 having the lowest.\\n\\nThe Net Asset Value (NAV) is based on the value of the underlying assets owned by the fund, minus its liabilities, and then\\ndivided by the number of shares outstanding.\\n\\nA financial instrument’s categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is\\nsignificant to the fair value measurement.\\n\\nFollowing is a description of the valuation methodologies used for the investments measured at fair value.\\n\\n• Short-term investment funds — Cash and quoted short-term instruments are valued at the closing price or the amount\\nheld on deposit by the custodian bank. Other investments are through investment vehicles valued using the NAV\\nprovided by the administrator of the fund. The NAV is a quoted price in a market that is not active and classified as\\nLevel 2.\\n\\n• Government and agency securities — A limited number of these investments are valued at the closing price reported on\\nthe major market on which the individual securities are traded. Where quoted prices are available in an active market,\\nthe investments are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. If quoted market prices are not available for the\\nspecific security, then fair values are estimated by using pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar\\ncharacteristics or discounted cash flows. When quoted market prices for a security are not available in an active market,\\nthey are classified as Level 2.\\n\\n• Debt instruments — A limited number of these investments are valued at the closing price reported on the major market\\non which the individual securities are traded. Where quoted prices are available in an active market, the investments are\\nclassified as Level 1. If quoted market prices are not available for the specific security, then fair values are estimated by\\n\\n70 • Johnson & Johnson 2022 Annual Report\\n\\n\\x0cusing pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flows and are classified\\nas Level 2. Level 3 debt instruments are priced based on unobservable inputs.\\n\\n• Equity securities — Equity securities are valued at the closing price reported on the major market on which the individual\\n\\nsecurities are traded. Substantially all equity securities are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy.\\n\\n• Commingled funds — These investment vehicles are valued using the NAV provided by the fund administrator. Assets in\\n\\nthe Level 2 category have a quoted market price.\\n\\n• Other assets — Other assets are represented primarily by limited partnerships. These investment vehicles are valued\\nusing the NAV provided by the fund administrator. Other assets that are exchange listed and actively traded are\\nclassified as Level 1, while inactively traded assets are classified as Level 2.\\n\\nThe following table sets forth the Retirement Plans’ investments measured at fair value as of December 31, 2022 and\\nDecember 31, 2021:\\n\\nQuoted Prices\\nin Active\\nMarkets for\\nIdentical Assets\\n(Level 1)\\n\\nSignificant\\nOther\\nObservable\\nInputs\\n(Level 2)\\n\\nSignificant\\nUnobservable\\nInputs(1)\\n(Level 3)\\n\\nInvestments\\nMeasured at\\nNet Asset\\nValue\\n\\nTotal Assets\\n\\n(Dollars in Millions)\\n\\n2022\\n\\n2021\\n\\n2022\\n\\n2021\\n\\n2022\\n\\n2021\\n\\n2022\\n\\n2021\\n\\n2022\\n\\n2021\\n\\nShort-term investment funds\\n\\n$33\\n\\n102\\n\\n13\\n\\n1,033\\n\\nGovernment and agency securities\\n\\nDebt instruments\\n\\nEquity securities\\n\\nCommingled funds\\n\\nOther assets\\n\\n—\\n\\n—\\n\\n— 5,863\\n\\n7,016\\n\\n— 3,681\\n\\n3,505\\n\\n8,846 14,107\\n\\n2\\n\\n2\\n\\n—\\n\\n—\\n\\n— 4,362\\n\\n5,496\\n\\n—\\n\\n33\\n\\n34\\n\\nInvestments at fair value\\n\\n$8,879 14,209 13,954 17,086\\n\\n(1)\\n\\nThe activity for the Level 3 assets is not significant for all years presented.\\n\\n—\\n\\n—\\n\\n—\\n\\n—\\n\\n56\\n\\n13\\n\\n69\\n\\n—\\n\\n—\\n\\n—\\n\\n—\\n\\n—\\n\\n—\\n\\n—\\n\\n—\\n\\n—\\n\\n46\\n\\n1,135\\n\\n— 5,863\\n\\n7,016\\n\\n— 3,681\\n\\n3,505\\n\\n— 8,848 14,109\\n\\n105\\n\\n6,106\\n\\n8,708 10,524 14,309\\n\\n15\\n\\n2,506\\n\\n1,807\\n\\n2,552\\n\\n1,856\\n\\n120\\n\\n8,612 10,515 31,514 41,930\\n\\nThe Company’s Other Benefit Plans are unfunded except for U.S. commingled funds (Level 2) of $78 million and $102\\nmillion at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively.\\n\\nThe fair value of Johnson & Johnson Common Stock directly held in plan assets was $21 million (0.1% of total plan\\nassets) at December 31, 2022 and $385 million (0.9% of total plan assets) at December 31, 2021.\\n\\n11.

International Currency Translation\\n\\nFor translation of its subsidiaries operating in non-U.S. Dollar currencies, the Company has determined that the local\\ncurrencies of its international subsidiaries are the functional currencies except those in highly inflationary economies, which\\nare defined as those which have had compound cumulative rates of inflation of 100% or more during the past three years,\\nor where a substantial portion of its cash flows are not in the local currency. For the majority of the Company’s subsidiaries\\nthe local currency is the functional currency.\\n\\nIn consolidating international subsidiaries, balance sheet currency effects are recorded as a component of accumulated\\nother comprehensive income. The other current and non-current assets line within the Statement of Cash flows includes\\nthe impact of foreign currency translation. This equity account includes the results of translating certain balance sheet\\nassets and liabilities at current exchange rates and some accounts at historical rates, except for those located in highly\\ninflationary economies, (Argentina and Venezuela). Beginning in the fiscal second quarter of 2022, the Company also\\naccounted for operations in Turkey as highly inflationary. The translation of balance sheet accounts for highly inflationary\\neconomies are reflected in the operating results.\\n\\nA rollforward of the changes during fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020 for foreign currency translation adjustments is\\nincluded in Note 13.\\n\\nNet currency transaction gains and losses included in Other (income) expense were losses of $328 million, $236 million\\nand $209 million in fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\\n\\n15.

Common Stock, Stock Option Plans and Stock Compensation Agreements\\n\\nAt January 1, 2023, the Company had one stock-based compensation plan. The shares outstanding are for contracts\\nunder the Company’s 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan and the 2022 Long-Term Incentive Plan. The 2012 Long-Term\\nIncentive Plan expired on April 26, 2022. All awards (stock options, restricted shares units and performance share units)\\ngranted subsequent to that date were under the 2022 Long-Term Incentive Plan. Under the 2022 Long-Term Incentive\\nPlan, the Company may issue up to 150 million shares of common stock, of which up to 110 million shares of common\\nstock may be issued subject to stock options or stock appreciation rights and up to 40 million shares of common stock\\nmay be issued subject to full value awards. Awards will generally be counted on a 1-for-1 basis against the share reserve,\\nprovided that if more than 40 million full value awards are granted, each full value award in excess of 40 million will be\\ncounted on a 5-for-1 basis against the share reserve. Shares available for future grants under the 2022 Long-Term\\nIncentive Plan were 150 million at the end of fiscal year 2022.\\n\\nJohnson & Johnson 2022 Annual Report • 73\\n\\n\\x0cThe compensation cost that has been charged against income for these plans was $1,138 million, $1,135 million and\\n$1,005 million for fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The total income tax benefit recognized in the income\\nstatement for share-based compensation costs was $196 million, $218 million and $210 million for fiscal years 2022,\\n2021 and 2020, respectively. The Company also recognized additional income tax benefits of $282 million, $223 million\\nand $248 million for fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, for which options were exercised or restricted shares\\nwere vested. The total unrecognized compensation cost was $939 million, $862 million and $804 million for fiscal years\\n2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The weighted average period for this cost to be recognized was 1.80 years,\\n1.78 years and 1.76 years for fiscal years 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. Share-based compensation costs\\ncapitalized as part of inventory were insignificant in all periods.\\n\\nThe Company settles employee benefit equity issuances with treasury shares. Treasury shares are replenished through\\nmarket purchases throughout the year for the number of shares used to settle employee benefit equity issuances.\\n\\nStock Options\\n\\nStock options expire 10 years from the date of grant and vest over service periods that range from 6 months to 4 years. All\\noptions are granted at the average of the high and low prices of the Company’s Common Stock on the New York Stock\\nExchange on the date of grant.\\n\\nThe fair value of each option award was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option valuation model\\nthat uses the assumptions noted in the following table. For 2022, 2021, and 2020 grants, expected volatility represents a\\nblended rate of 10-year weekly historical overall volatility rate, and a 5-week average implied volatility rate based on at-the-\\nmoney traded Johnson & Johnson options with a life of 2 years. For all grants, historical data is used to determine the\\nexpected life of the option. The risk-free rate was based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.\\n\\nThe average fair value of options granted was $23.23, $20.86 and $16.42, in fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020,\\nrespectively.

Acquisitions and Divestitures\\n\\nDuring the fiscal year 2022, certain businesses were acquired for $17.7 billion in cash and $1.1 billion of liabilities\\nassumed. These acquisitions were accounted for using the acquisition method and, accordingly, results of operations have\\nbeen included in the financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition.\\n\\nThe excess of purchase price over the estimated fair value of tangible assets acquired amounted to $17.3 billion and has\\nbeen assigned to identifiable intangible assets, with any residual recorded to goodwill.\\n\\nThe fiscal year 2022 acquisitions primarily included Abiomed, Inc. (Abiomed). The remaining acquisitions were not\\nmaterial.\\n\\nOn December 22, 2022, the Company completed the acquisition of Abiomed, a leading, first-to-market provider of\\ncardiovascular medical technology with a first-in-kind portfolio for the treatment of coronary artery disease and heart failure\\nwhich also has an extensive innovation pipeline of life-saving technologies. The transaction broadens the Company’s\\nposition as a growing cardiovascular innovator, advancing the standard of care in heart failure and recovery, one of\\nhealthcare’s largest areas of unmet need. The transaction was accounted for as a business combination and the results of\\noperations were included in the MedTech segment as of the date of the acquisition. The acquisition was completed\\nthrough a tender offer for all outstanding shares. The consideration paid in the acquisition consisted of an upfront payment\\nof $380.00 per share in cash, amounting to $17.1 billion, net of cash acquired, as well as a non-tradeable contingent\\nvalue right (“CVR”) entitling the holder to receive up to $35.00 per share in cash (which with respect to the CVRs total\\napproximately $1.6 billion in the aggregate) if certain commercial and clinical milestones are achieved. The corresponding\\nenterprise value (without taking into account the CVRs) of approximately $16.5 billion includes cash, cash equivalents and\\nmarketable securities acquired.\\n\\nThe milestones of the CVR consist of:\\n\\na. $17.50 per share, payable if net sales for Abiomed products exceeds $3.7 billion during Johnson & Johnson’s fiscal\\nsecond quarter of 2027 through fiscal first quarter of 2028, or if this threshold is not met during this period and is\\nsubsequently met during any rolling four quarter period up to the end of Johnson & Johnson’s fiscal first quarter of\\n2029, $8.75 per share;\\n\\nb. $7.50 per share payable upon FDA premarket application approval of the use of Impella® products in ST-elevated\\n\\nmyocardial infarction (STEMI) patients without cardiogenic shock by January 1, 2028; and\\n\\nJohnson & Johnson 2022 Annual Report • 83\\n\\n\\x0cc. $10.00 per share payable upon the first publication of a Class I recommendation for the use of Impella® products\\nin high risk PCI or STEMI with or without cardiogenic shock within four years from their respective clinical endpoint\\npublication dates, but in all cases no later than December 31, 2029.\\n\\nThe fair value of the acquisition was allocated to assets acquired of $19.9 billion (net of $0.3 billion cash acquired),\\nprimarily to goodwill for $10.9 billion, amortizable intangible assets for $6.6 billion, IPR&D for $1.1 billion, marketable\\nsecurities of $0.6 billion and liabilities assumed of $2.8 billion, which includes the fair value of the contingent\\nconsideration mentioned above for $0.7 billion and deferred taxes of $1.8 billion. The goodwill is primarily attributable to\\nthe commercial acceleration and expansion of the portfolio and is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. The\\ncontingent consideration was recorded in Other Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\\n\\nAs the acquisition occurred in December 2022, the Company is still finalizing the allocation of the purchase price to the\\nindividual assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The allocation of the purchase price included in the current period\\nbalance sheet is based on the best estimate of management and is preliminary and subject to change. To assist\\nmanagement in the allocation, the Company engaged valuation specialists to prepare appraisals. The Company will finalize\\nthe amounts recognized as the information necessary to complete the analysis is obtained. The Company expects to\\nfinalize these amounts as soon as possible but no later than one year from the acquisition date.\\n\\nThe amortizable intangible assets were primarily comprised of already in-market products of the Impella® platform with an\\naverage weighted life of 14 years. The IPR&D assets were valued for technology programs for unapproved products. The\\nvalue of the IPR&D was calculated using probability-adjusted cash flow projections discounted for the risk inherent in such\\nprojects. The probability of success factor ranged from 52% to 70%. The discount rate applied was 9.5%.\\n\\nIn 2022, the Company recorded acquisition related costs before tax of approximately $0.3 billion, which was recorded in\\nOther (income)/expense.\\n\\nDuring fiscal year 2021, the Company did not make any material acquisitions.\\n\\nDuring fiscal year 2020, certain businesses were acquired for $7.3 billion in cash and $0.4 billion of liabilities assumed.\\nThese acquisitions were accounted for using the acquisition method and, accordingly, results of operations have been\\nincluded in the financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition.\\n\\nThe excess of purchase price over the estimated fair value of tangible assets acquired amounted to $7.5 billion and has\\nbeen assigned to identifiable intangible assets, with any residual recorded to goodwill.\\n\\nThe fiscal year 2020 acquisitions primarily included: all rights to the investigational compound bermekimab, which has\\nmultiple dermatological indications, along with certain employees from XBiotech Inc. (XBiotech), Momenta\\nPharmaceuticals, Inc. (Momenta), a company that discovers and develops novel therapies for immune-mediated diseases\\nand the outstanding shares in Verb Surgical Inc., a company with significant robotics and data science capabilities.\\n\\nDuring the fiscal first quarter of 2020, the Company completed the acquisition of all rights to the investigational compound\\nbermekimab, which has multiple dermatological indications, along with certain employees from XBiotech Inc., for a\\npurchase price of $0.8 billion. The fair value of the acquisition was allocated primarily to non-amortizable intangible assets,\\nprimarily IPR&D, for $0.8 billion applying a probability of success factor that ranged from 20% to 60% to reflect inherent\\ndevelopment, regulatory and commercial risk for the different indications. The discount rate applied was approximately\\n16%. The transaction was accounted for as a business combination and included in the Pharmaceutical segment. In fiscal\\n2022, the Company recorded an intangible asset impairment charge of approximately $0.8 billion related to this in-\\nprocess research and development asset.\\n\\nAdditionally, in the fiscal first quarter of 2020, the Company completed the acquisition of all outstanding shares in Verb\\nSurgical Inc., a company with significant robotics and data science capabilities, including those shares previously held by\\nVerily. The transaction was accounted for as a business combination and included in the MedTech segment. The fair value\\nof the acquisition was allocated primarily to non-amortizable intangible assets, primarily IPR&D, for $0.4 billion, goodwill for\\n$0.2 billion, other assets of $0.2 billion and liabilities assumed of $0.3 billion. The fair value of the Company’s previously\\nheld equity investment in Verb Surgical Inc. was $0.4 billion.\\n\\nOn October 1, 2020, the Company completed the acquisition of Momenta for a purchase price of approximately\\n$6.1 billion, net of cash acquired. The fair value of the acquisition was allocated primarily to non-amortizable intangible\\nassets (IPR&D) of $6.0 billion, goodwill of $1.2 billion, other assets of $0.5 billion and liabilities of $1.6 billion. The assets\\nacquired are intended to address substantial unmet medical need in maternal-fetal disorders, neuro-inflammatory\\ndisorders, rheumatology, dermatology and autoimmune hematology. Depending on the asset, probability of success\\nfactors ranging from 20% to 77% were used in the fair value calculation to reflect inherent development and regulatory\\n\\n84 • Johnson & Johnson 2022 Annual Report\\n\\n\\x0crisk of the IPR&D. The discount rate applied was approximately 13%. The goodwill is primarily attributable to synergies\\nexpected to arise from the business acquisition and is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. The transaction was\\naccounted for as a business combination and included in the Pharmaceutical segment.\\n\\nIn accordance with U.S. GAAP standards related to business combinations, and goodwill and other intangible assets,\\nsupplemental pro forma information for fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020 is not provided, as the impact of the\\naforementioned acquisitions did not have a material effect on the Company’s results of operations.\\n\\nDivestitures\\n\\nDuring fiscal year 2022, the Company did not make any material divestitures.\\n\\nDuring fiscal year 2021, in separate transactions, the Company divested two brands outside the U.S. within the\\nPharmaceutical segment. The Company recognized a pre-tax gain recorded in Other (income) expense, net, of\\napproximately $0.6 billion.\\n\\nDuring fiscal year 2020, the Company sold 11.8 million shares of Idorsia LTD (Idorsia), or its 8.3% ownership in the\\ncompany at that time. The transaction resulted in gross proceeds of approximately CHF 337 million ($357 million) based\\non a sales price of CHF 28.55/share and resulted in an immaterial net loss. At the end of fiscal 2020, the Company had\\nrights to approximately 38.7 million shares through a convertible loan with a principal amount of CHF 445 million (due June\\n2027). During fiscal year 2021, the Company converted CHF 110 million ($120 million) of this loan into approximately\\n9.6 million shares of Idorsia which were reflected at fair value as of January 2, 2022. During the fiscal third quarter of\\n2021, the Company’s undrawn credit facility with Idorsia was terminated.\\n\\n19. Legal Proceedings\\n\\nJohnson & Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in various lawsuits and claims regarding product liability;\\nintellectual property; commercial; indemnification and other matters; governmental investigations; and other legal\\nproceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of their business.\\n\\nThe Company records accruals for loss contingencies associated with these legal matters when it is probable that a\\nliability will be incurred, and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. As of January 1, 2023, the Company has\\ndetermined that the liabilities associated with certain litigation matters are probable and can be reasonably estimated. The\\nCompany has accrued for these matters and will continue to monitor each related legal issue and adjust accruals as might\\nbe warranted based on new information and further developments in accordance with ASC 450-20-25. For these and\\nother litigation and regulatory matters discussed below for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible, the Company\\nis unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond the amounts accrued. Amounts accrued for legal\\ncontingencies often result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties that rely heavily on\\nestimates and assumptions including timing of related payments. The ability to make such estimates and judgments can be\\naffected by various factors including, among other things, whether damages sought in the proceedings are\\nunsubstantiated or indeterminate; scientific and legal discovery has not commenced or is not complete; proceedings are in\\nearly stages; matters present legal uncertainties; there are significant facts in dispute; procedural or jurisdictional issues;\\nthe uncertainty and unpredictability of the number of potential claims; ability to achieve comprehensive multi-party\\nsettlements; complexity of related cross-claims and counterclaims; and/or there are numerous parties involved. To the\\nextent adverse awards, judgments or verdicts have been rendered against the Company, the Company does not record an\\naccrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be reasonably estimated.\\n\\nIn the Company’s opinion, based on its examination of these matters, its experience to date and discussions with counsel,\\nthe ultimate outcome of legal proceedings, net of liabilities accrued in the Company’s balance sheet, is not expected to\\nhave a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position. However, the resolution of, or increase in accruals for,\\none or more of these matters in any reporting period may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of\\noperations and cash flows for that period.\\n\\nPRODUCT LIABILITY\\n\\nThe Company and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in numerous product liability claims and lawsuits involving\\nmultiple products. Claimants in these cases seek substantial compensatory and, where available, punitive damages. While\\nthe Company believes it has substantial defenses, it is not feasible to predict the ultimate outcome of litigation. From time\\nto time, even if it has substantial defenses, the Company considers isolated settlements based on a variety of\\ncircumstances. The Company has established accruals for product liability claims and lawsuits in compliance with\\n\\nJohnson & Johnson 2022 Annual Report • 85\\n\\n\\x0cASC 450-20 based on currently available information, which in some cases may be limited. The Company accrues an\\nestimate of the legal defense costs needed to defend each matter when those costs are probable and can be reasonably\\nestimated. For certain of these matters, the Company has accrued additional amounts such as estimated costs associated\\nwith settlements, damages and other losses. Product liability accruals can represent projected product liability for\\nthousands of claims around the world, each in different litigation environments and with different fact patterns. Changes to\\nthe accruals may be required in the future as additional information becomes available.\\nThe most significant of these cases include: the DePuy ASR XL Acetabular System and DePuy ASR Hip Resurfacing\\nSystem; the PINNACLE Acetabular Cup System; pelvic meshes; RISPERDAL; body powders containing talc, primarily\\nJOHNSON’S Baby Powder; ETHICON PHYSIOMESH Flexible Composite Mesh; ELMIRON; and TYLENOL. As of\\nJanuary 1, 2023, in the United States there were approximately 170 plaintiffs with direct claims in pending lawsuits\\nregarding injuries allegedly due to the DePuy ASR XL Acetabular System and DePuy ASR Hip Resurfacing System; 1,400\\nwith respect to the PINNACLE Acetabular Cup System; 9,000 with respect to pelvic meshes; 1,100 with respect to\\nRISPERDAL; 40,300 with respect to body powders containing talc; 2,100 with respect to ETHICON PHYSIOMESH\\nFlexible Composite Mesh; 2,000 with respect to ELMIRON; and 170 with respect to TYLENOL. The number of pending\\nlawsuits is expected to fluctuate as certain lawsuits are settled or dismissed and additional lawsuits are filed.\\nIn August 2010, DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. (DePuy) announced a worldwide voluntary recall of its ASR XL Acetabular\\nSystem and DePuy ASR Hip Resurfacing System (ASR Hip) used in hip replacement surgery. Claims for personal injury\\nhave been made against DePuy and the Company. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been organized\\nas a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. Litigation has also been\\nfiled in countries outside of the United States, primarily in the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Ireland, Germany, India\\nand Italy. In November 2013, DePuy reached an agreement with a Court-appointed committee of lawyers representing\\nASR Hip plaintiffs to establish a program to settle claims with eligible ASR Hip patients in the United States who had\\nsurgery to replace their ASR Hips, known as revision surgery, as of August 2013. DePuy reached additional agreements in\\nFebruary 2015 and March 2017, which further extended the settlement program to include ASR Hip patients who had\\nrevision surgeries after August 2013 and prior to February 15, 2017. This settlement program has resolved more than\\n10,000 claims, thereby bringing to resolution significant ASR Hip litigation activity in the United States. However, lawsuits\\nin the United States remain, and the settlement program does not address litigation outside of the United States. In\\nAustralia, a class action settlement was reached that resolved the claims of the majority of ASR Hip patients in that\\ncountry. In Canada, the Company has reached agreements to settle the class actions filed in that country. The Company\\ncontinues to receive information with respect to potential additional costs associated with this recall on a worldwide basis.\\nThe Company has established accruals for the costs associated with the United States settlement program and ASR Hip-\\nrelated product liability litigation.\\nClaims for personal injury have also been made against DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. and the Company (collectively, DePuy)\\nrelating to the PINNACLE Acetabular Cup System used in hip replacement surgery. Product liability lawsuits continue to\\nbe filed, and the Company continues to receive information with respect to potential costs and the anticipated number of\\ncases. Most cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been organized as a multi-district litigation in the\\nUnited States District Court for the Northern District of Texas (Texas MDL). Beginning on June 1, 2022, the Judicial Panel\\non Multidistrict Litigation ceased transfer of new cases into the Texas MDL, and there are now cases pending in federal\\ncourt outside the Texas MDL. Litigation also has been filed in state courts and in countries outside of the United States.\\nPrior to 2019, several adverse verdicts had been rendered against DePuy, one of which was reversed on appeal and\\nremanded for retrial. During the first quarter of 2019, DePuy established a United States settlement program to resolve\\nthese cases. As part of the settlement program, adverse verdicts have been settled. The Company has established an\\naccrual for product liability litigation associated with the PINNACLE Acetabular Cup System and the related settlement\\nprogram.\\nClaims for personal injury have been made against Ethicon, Inc. (Ethicon) and the Company arising out of Ethicon’s pelvic\\nmesh devices used to treat stress urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse. The Company continues to receive\\ninformation with respect to potential costs and additional cases. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States had\\nbeen organized as a multi-district litigation (MDL) in the United States District Court for the Southern District of West\\nVirginia. In March 2021, the MDL Court entered an order closing the MDL. The MDL Court has remanded cases for trial to\\nthe jurisdictions where the case was originally filed and additional pelvic mesh lawsuits have been filed, and remain,\\noutside of the MDL. The Company has settled or otherwise resolved the majority of the United States cases and the\\nestimated costs associated with these settlements and the remaining cases are reflected in the Company’s accruals. In\\naddition, class actions and individual personal injury cases or claims seeking damages for alleged injury resulting from\\nEthicon’s pelvic mesh devices have been commenced in various countries outside of the United States, including claims\\nand cases in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Ireland, Italy, Spain and Slovenia and class actions in\\nIsrael, Australia, Canada and South Africa. In November 2019, the Federal Court of Australia issued a judgment regarding\\n\\n86 • Johnson & Johnson 2022 Annual Report\\n\\n\\x0cits findings with respect to liability in relation to the three Lead Applicants and generally in relation to the design,\\nmanufacture, pre and post-market assessments and testing, and supply and promotion of the devices in Australia used to\\ntreat stress urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse. In September 2022, after exhausting its appeals, the Company\\nreached an in-principle agreement to resolve the two pelvic mesh class actions in Australia, pending Federal Court\\napproval. In November 2022, the application for approval of the settlement was filed, and a hearing on the settlement has\\nbeen scheduled for the end of February 2023. The class actions in Canada were discontinued in 2020 as a result of a\\nsettlement of a group of cases and an agreement to resolve the Israeli class action was reached in May 2021. The parties\\nin the Israeli class action are currently finalizing the terms of the settlement. A motion to approve the settlement was filed\\nwith the Court. The Company has established accruals with respect to product liability litigation associated with Ethicon’s\\npelvic mesh products.\\n\\nFollowing a June 2016 worldwide market withdrawal of ETHICON PHYSIOMESH Flexible Composite Mesh\\n(Physiomesh), claims for personal injury have been made against Ethicon, Inc. (Ethicon) and the Company alleging\\npersonal injury arising out of the use of this hernia mesh device. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States have\\nbeen organized as a multi-district litigation (MDL) in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia. A\\nmulti-county litigation (MCL) also has been formed in New Jersey state court and assigned to Atlantic County for cases\\npending in New Jersey. In addition to the matters in the MDL and MCL, there are additional lawsuits pending in the\\nUnited States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, which are part of the MDL for polypropylene mesh devices\\nmanufactured by C.R. Bard, Inc., and lawsuits pending in two New Jersey MCLs formed for Proceed/Proceed Ventral\\nPatch and Prolene Hernia systems, and lawsuits pending outside the United States. In May 2021, Ethicon and lead\\ncounsel for the plaintiffs entered into a term sheet to resolve approximately 3,600 Physiomesh cases (covering\\napproximately 4,300 plaintiffs) pending in the MDL and MCL at that time. A master settlement agreement (MSA) was\\nentered into in September 2021 and includes 3,729 cases in the MDL and MCL. All deadlines and trial settings in those\\nproceedings are currently stayed pending the completion of the settlement agreement. Of the cases subject to the MSA,\\n2,236 have been dismissed with prejudice. Post-settlement cases in the Physiomesh MDL and MCL are subject to docket\\ncontrol orders requiring early expert reports and discovery requirements. As of January 2023, there are approximately 208\\nactive cases subject to these orders which are being reviewed and evaluated.\\n\\nClaims have also been filed against Ethicon and the Company alleging personal injuries arising from the PROCEED Mesh\\nand PROCEED Ventral Patch hernia mesh products. In March 2019, the New Jersey Supreme Court entered an order\\nconsolidating these cases pending in New Jersey as an MCL in Atlantic County Superior Court. Additional cases have\\nbeen filed in various federal and state courts in the United States, and in jurisdictions outside the United States.\\n\\nEthicon and the Company also have been subject to claims for personal injuries arising from the PROLENE Polypropylene\\nHernia System. In January 2020, the New Jersey Supreme Court created an MCL in Atlantic County Superior Court to\\nhandle such cases. Cases involving this product have also been filed in other federal and state courts in the United States.\\n\\nIn October 2022, an agreement in principle, subject to various conditions, was reached to settle the majority of the\\npending cases involving Proceed, Proceed Ventral Patch, Prolene Hernia System and related multi-layered mesh products.\\nAll litigation activities in the two New Jersey MCLs are stayed pending resolution of the proposed settlement. Future cases\\nthat are filed in the New Jersey MCLs will be subject to docket control orders requiring early expert reports and discovery\\nrequirements.\\n\\nThe Company has established accruals with respect to product liability litigation associated with ETHICON\\nPHYSIOMESH Flexible Composite Mesh, PROCEED Mesh and PROCEED Ventral Patch, and PROLENE Polypropylene\\nHernia System products.\\n\\nClaims for personal injury have been made against Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and the Company arising out of the use\\nof RISPERDAL, and related compounds, indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia, acute manic or mixed episodes\\nassociated with bipolar I disorder and irritability associated with autism. Lawsuits primarily have been filed in state courts in\\nPennsylvania, California, and Missouri. Other actions are pending in various courts in the United States and Canada.\\nProduct liability lawsuits continue to be filed, and the Company continues to receive information with respect to potential\\ncosts and the anticipated number of cases. The Company has successfully defended a number of these cases but there\\nhave been verdicts against the Company, including a verdict in October 2019 of $8.0 billion of punitive damages related\\nto one plaintiff, which the trial judge reduced to $6.8 million in January 2020. In September 2021, the Company entered\\ninto a settlement in principle with the counsel representing plaintiffs in this matter and in substantially all of the outstanding\\ncases in the United States. The costs associated with this and other settlements are reflected in the Company’s accruals.\\n\\nClaims for personal injury arising out of the use of XARELTO, an oral anticoagulant, have been made against Janssen\\nPharmaceuticals, Inc. (JPI); the Company; and JPI’s collaboration partner for XARELTO, Bayer Healthcare AG, and certain\\n\\nJohnson & Johnson 2022 Annual Report • 87\\n\\n\\x0cof its affiliates. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been organized as a multi-district litigation in the\\nUnited States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana. In addition, cases were filed in state courts across the\\nUnited States. Many of these cases were consolidated into a state mass tort litigation in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and in\\na coordinated proceeding in Los Angeles, California. Class action lawsuits also have been filed in Canada. In March 2019,\\nJPI and the Company announced an agreement in principle to settle the XARELTO cases in the United States; the\\nsettlement agreement was executed in May 2019, the settlement became final in December 2019, and the settlement was\\nfunded in January 2020. This resolved the majority of cases pending in the United States. The Company has established\\naccruals for its costs associated with the United States settlement program and XARELTO related product liability\\nlitigation.\\n\\nA significant number of personal injury claims alleging that talc causes cancer were made against Johnson & Johnson\\nConsumer Inc. and the Company arising out of the use of body powders containing talc, primarily JOHNSON’S Baby\\nPowder. The number of these personal injury lawsuits, filed in state and federal courts in the United States as well as\\noutside of the United States, continued to increase.\\n\\nIn talc cases that previously have gone to trial, the Company has obtained a number of defense verdicts, but there also\\nhave been verdicts against the Company, many of which have been reversed on appeal. In June 2020, the Missouri Court\\nof Appeals reversed in part and affirmed in part a July 2018 verdict of $4.7 billion in Ingham v. Johnson & Johnson, et al.,\\nNo. ED 207476 (Mo. App.), reducing the overall award to $2.1 billion. An application for transfer of the case to the\\nMissouri Supreme Court was subsequently denied and in June 2021, a petition for certiorari, seeking a review of the\\nIngham decision by the United States Supreme Court, was denied. In June 2021, the Company paid the award, which,\\nincluding interest, totaled approximately $2.5 billion. The facts and circumstances, including the terms of the award, were\\nunique to the Ingham decision and not representative of other claims brought against the Company. The Company\\ncontinues to believe that it has strong legal grounds to contest the other talc verdicts that it has appealed.\\nNotwithstanding the Company’s confidence in the safety of its talc products, in certain circumstances the Company has\\nsettled cases.\\n\\nIn October 2021, Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc. (Old JJCI) implemented a corporate restructuring (the 2021\\nCorporate Restructuring). As a result of that restructuring, Old JJCI ceased to exist and three new entities were created:\\n(a) LTL Management LLC, a North Carolina limited liability company (LTL or Debtor); (b) Royalty A&M LLC, a North\\nCarolina limited liability company and a direct subsidiary of LTL (RAM); and (c) the Debtor’s direct parent, Johnson &\\nJohnson Consumer Inc., a New Jersey company (New JJCI). The Debtor received certain of Old JJCI’s assets and became\\nsolely responsible for the talc-related liabilities of Old JJCI, including all liabilities related in any way to injury or damage, or\\nalleged injury or damage, sustained or incurred in the purchase or use of, or exposure to, talc, including talc contained in\\nany product, or to the risk of, or responsibility for, any such damage or injury, except for any liabilities for which the\\nexclusive remedy is provided under a workers’ compensation statute or act (the Talc-Related Liabilities).\\n\\nIn October 2021, notwithstanding the Company’s confidence in the safety of its talc products, the Debtor filed a voluntary\\npetition with the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of North Carolina, Charlotte Division, seeking\\nrelief under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code (the LTL Bankruptcy Case). As a result of the LTL Bankruptcy Case, the\\nNorth Carolina Bankruptcy Court entered a temporary restraining order staying all litigation against LTL and Old JJCI. On\\nNovember 15, 2021, the North Carolina Bankruptcy Court confirmed the scope of the stay, issuing a Preliminary Injunction\\n(PI) prohibiting and enjoining the commencement and prosecution of talc-related claims against LTL, Old JJCI, New JJCI,\\nthe Company, other of their corporate affiliates, identified retailers, insurance companies, and certain other parties (the\\nProtected Parties). The LTL Bankruptcy Case was transferred to the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of\\nNew Jersey in November 2021, and that court extended the PI through the end of February 2022. Claimants filed motions\\nto dismiss the LTL Bankruptcy Case and, following a multiple day hearing, the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court denied those\\nmotions by order issued in March 2022. The New Jersey Bankruptcy Court simultaneously issued another order extending\\nthe stay as to the Protected Parties. The claimants subsequently filed notices of appeal as to the denial of the motions to\\ndismiss and the extension of the stay. In May 2022, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals granted the petitions to appeal. The\\nbriefing and oral argument on the appeal were completed in September 2022. On January 30, 2023, the Third Circuit\\nreversed the Bankruptcy Court’s ruling and remanded to the Bankruptcy Court to dismiss the LTL bankruptcy. LTL filed a\\npetition for rehearing on the decision.\\n\\nWhile the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court’s order effectively stays all of the Company’s talc-related personal injury litigation,\\nLTL has agreed to lift the stay on a small number of appeals where appeal bonds have been filed.\\n\\nThe Company has agreed to provide funding to LTL for the payment of amounts the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court\\ndetermines are owed by LTL and the establishment of a $2 billion trust in furtherance of this purpose. The Company has\\nestablished a reserve for approximately $2 billion in connection with the aforementioned trust. After and as a result of the\\n\\n88 • Johnson & Johnson 2022 Annual Report\\n\\n\\x0cfiling of the LTL Bankruptcy Case, the Company de-consolidated LTL, which is a related party. The impact of the de-\\nconsolidation is not material to the Company. The parties have not yet reached a resolution of all talc matters in the LTL\\nBankruptcy Case, and the Company is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond the amount accrued.\\n\\nA class action advancing claims relating to industrial talc was filed against the Company and others in New Jersey state\\ncourt in May 2022 (the Edley Class Action). The Edley Class Action asserts, among other things, that the Company\\nfraudulently defended past asbestos personal injury lawsuits arising from exposure to industrial talc mined, milled, and\\nmanufactured before January 6, 1989 by the Company’s then wholly owned subsidiary, Windsor Minerals, Inc., which is\\ncurrently a debtor in the Imerys Bankruptcy described hereafter. The Company removed the Edley Class Action to federal\\ncourt in the District of New Jersey. In July 2022, Imerys filed a motion in the Imerys Bankruptcy to stay the Edley Class\\nAction, which was denied in August 2022. In October 2022, the Company filed motions to dismiss and to deny\\ncertification of a class to pursue the Edley Class Action in the New Jersey District Court.\\n\\nIn February 2019, the Company’s talc supplier, Imerys Talc America, Inc. and two of its affiliates, Imerys Talc Vermont, Inc.\\nand Imerys Talc Canada, Inc. (collectively, Imerys) filed a voluntary petition under chapter 11 of the United States Code\\n(the Bankruptcy Code) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (Imerys Bankruptcy). The Imerys\\nBankruptcy relates to Imerys’s potential liability for personal injury from exposure to talcum powder sold by Imerys. In its\\nbankruptcy, Imerys alleges it has claims against the Company for indemnification and rights to joint insurance proceeds. In\\nMay 2020, Imerys, its parent Imerys S.A., the Tort Claimants’ Committee (TCC), and the Future Claimants’ Representative\\n(FCR) (collectively, the Plan Proponents) filed their Plan of Reorganization (the Plan) and the Disclosure Statement related\\nthereto. The Plan Proponents have since filed numerous amendments to the Plan and Disclosure Statement. A hearing on\\nthe Plan Proponent’s Disclosure Statement was held in January 2021, and the Court entered an order approving the\\nDisclosure Statement, allowing Imerys to proceed with soliciting votes on the Plan.\\n\\nIn March 2021, the Company voted to reject the Plan and opted out of the consensual releases in the Plan. In April 2021,\\nthe Plan Proponents announced the Plan had received the requisite number of accepting votes to confirm the Plan. The\\nCompany challenged certain improprieties with respect to portions of the vote and sought to disqualify those votes. In\\nOctober 2021, the Bankruptcy Court issued a ruling deeming thousands of votes as withdrawn.\\n\\nIn October 2021, Imerys cancelled the confirmation hearing on the Plan. Imerys, the TCC, the FCR, certain of Imerys’s\\ninsurers, and certain parties in the Cyprus Mines chapter 11 case (described below) (collectively the Mediation Parties)\\nagreed to engage in mediation. The most recent term of the mediation ended on December 31, 2022.\\n\\nIn July 2021, Imerys commenced an adversary proceeding against the Company in the Imerys Bankruptcy (the Imerys\\nAdversary Proceeding). The Imerys Adversary Proceeding sought, among other things, certain declarations with respect to\\nthe indemnification obligations allegedly owed by the Company to Imerys. The TCC and FCR simultaneously filed a motion\\nfor temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction seeking to enjoin the Company from undergoing a corporate\\nrestructuring that would separate the Company’s talc liabilities from its other assets. The Bankruptcy Court denied the\\nmotion. The Company thereafter filed a motion to dismiss the adversary proceeding. The Bankruptcy Court has not yet\\ndecided the motion to dismiss. In October 2021, the Company filed a Notice of Bankruptcy Filing and Stay of\\nProceedings clarifying that the automatic stay arising upon the filing of the LTL Bankruptcy Case should apply to the\\nImerys Adversary Proceeding.\\n\\nIn June 2020, Cyprus Mines Corporation and its parent, Cyprus Amax Minerals Company (CAMC) (together, Cyprus),\\nwhich had owned certain Imerys talc mines, filed an adversary proceeding against the Company and Imerys in the Imerys\\nBankruptcy seeking a declaration of indemnity rights under certain contractual agreements (the Cyprus Adversary\\nProceeding). The Company denies such indemnification is owed, and filed a motion to dismiss the adversary complaint. In\\nFebruary 2021, Cyprus filed a voluntary petition for relief under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code and filed its Disclosure\\nStatement and Plan (the Cyprus Plan). The Cyprus Plan contemplates a settlement with Imerys and talc claimants where\\nCyprus would make a monetary contribution to a trust established under the Imerys Plan in exchange for an injunction\\nagainst talc claims asserted against it and certain protected parties. Cyprus has not yet sought approval of its Disclosure\\nStatement and Plan. Cyprus, along with the TCC and FCR appointed in the Cyprus chapter 11 case, have agreed to\\nparticipate in the mediation with the Mediation Parties. In October 2021, the Company filed a Notice of Bankruptcy Filing\\nand Stay of Proceedings clarifying that the automatic stay arising upon the filing of the LTL Bankruptcy Case should apply\\nto the Cyprus Adversary Proceeding. In June 2022, Cyprus commenced an Adversary Proceeding in its chapter 11 case\\nseeking an order enforcing the automatic stay by enjoining parties from commencing or continuing “talc-related claims”\\nagainst CAMC. In June 2022, the court entered a preliminary injunction order enjoining claimants from pursuing talc-\\nrelated claims against CAMC through January 2023.\\n\\nJohnson & Johnson 2022 Annual Report • 89\\n\\n\\x0cIn February 2021, several of the Company’s insurers involved in coverage litigation in New Jersey State Court (the\\nCoverage Action) filed a motion in the Imerys Bankruptcy Court proceeding seeking a determination that the automatic\\nstay does not apply to the Coverage Action and, in the alternative, seeking relief from the automatic stay to allow them to\\ncontinue to litigate their claims in the Coverage Action. In March 2021, the Company filed a limited response and\\nreservation of rights with respect to the motion. The Court entered an agreed order modifying the stay to allow the\\nlitigation in the Coverage Action to continue. In October 2021, LTL filed a Notice of Bankruptcy Filing and Stay of\\nProceedings clarifying that the automatic stay arising upon the filing of the LTL Bankruptcy Case should apply to the\\nCoverage Action. In March 2022, the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court ruled that the LTL automatic stay applied to the\\nCoverage Action.\\n\\nIn February 2018, a securities class action lawsuit was filed against the Company and certain named officers in the\\nUnited States District Court for the District of New Jersey, alleging that the Company violated the federal securities laws by\\nfailing to disclose alleged asbestos contamination in body powders containing talc, primarily JOHNSON’S Baby Powder,\\nand that purchasers of the Company’s shares suffered losses as a result. Plaintiff is seeking damages. In April 2019, the\\nCompany moved to dismiss the complaint and briefing on the motion was complete as of August 2019. In December 2019,\\nthe Court denied, in part, the motion to dismiss. In March 2020, the Company answered the complaint. In April 2021,\\nbriefing on Plaintiff’s motion for class certification was completed. In July 2021, the Company filed a notice of supplemental\\nauthority in opposition to Plaintiff’s motion for class certification, and Plaintiff filed a response. In December 2021, the\\nCompany filed a motion to supplement the class certification record, and in January 2022, Plaintiff responded. In\\nMarch 2022, LTL asked the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court to stay the securities class action. In April 2022, Defendants filed\\na second motion to supplement the class certification record. In May 2022, the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court entered an\\norder staying the securities class action. Plaintiff has appealed the Bankruptcy Court’s order.\\n\\nA lawsuit was brought against the Company in the Superior Court of California for the County of San Diego alleging\\nviolations of California’s Consumer Legal Remedies Act (CLRA) relating to JOHNSON’S Baby Powder. In that lawsuit, the\\nplaintiffs allege that the Company violated the CLRA by failing to provide required Proposition 65 warnings. In July 2019,\\nthe Company filed a notice of removal to the United States District Court for the Southern District of California and\\nplaintiffs filed a second amended complaint shortly thereafter. In October 2019, the Company moved to dismiss the\\nsecond amended complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. In response to those motions,\\nplaintiffs filed a third amended complaint. In December 2019, the Company moved to dismiss the third amended complaint\\nfor failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. In April 2020, the Court granted the motion to dismiss but\\ngranted leave to amend. In May 2020, plaintiffs filed a Fourth Amended Complaint but indicated that they would be filing a\\nmotion for leave to file a fifth amended complaint. Plaintiffs filed a Fifth Amended Complaint in August 2020. The Company\\nmoved to dismiss the Fifth Amended Complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. In\\nJanuary 2021, the Court issued an Order and opinion ruling in the Company’s favor and granting the motion to dismiss\\nwith prejudice. In February 2021, Plaintiffs filed a Notice of Appeal with the Ninth Circuit. Plaintiffs filed their opening brief\\nin July 2021. The company filed its responsive brief in October 2021. In October 2021, Notice of Suggestion of\\nBankruptcy was filed with the Ninth Circuit. A bankruptcy stay was imposed in December 2021, and the Court held the\\nreply deadline in abeyance. In February 2022, the Bankruptcy Court issued an order extending the stay. The appeal\\ncontinues to be held in abeyance, with the Company being required to file periodic status updates.\\n\\nIn addition, the Company has received inquiries, subpoenas, and requests to produce documents regarding talc matters\\nand the LTL Bankruptcy Case from various governmental authorities. The Company has produced documents and\\nresponded to inquiries, and will continue to cooperate with government inquiries.\\n\\nClaims for personal injury have been made against a number of Johnson & Johnson companies, including Janssen\\nPharmaceuticals, Inc. and the Company, arising out of the use of INVOKANA, a prescription medication indicated to\\nimprove glycemic control in adults with Type 2 diabetes. In December 2016, lawsuits filed in federal courts in the\\nUnited States were organized as a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey.\\nCases have also been filed in state courts. Class action lawsuits have been filed in Canada. Product liability lawsuits\\ncontinue to be filed, and the Company continues to receive information with respect to potential costs and the anticipated\\nnumber of cases. The Company has settled or otherwise resolved many of the cases and claims in the United States and\\nthe costs associated with these settlements are reflected in the Company’s accruals.\\n\\nClaims for personal injury have been made against a number of Johnson & Johnson companies, including Janssen\\nPharmaceuticals, Inc. and the Company, arising out of the use of ELMIRON, a prescription medication indicated for the\\nrelief of bladder pain or discomfort associated with interstitial cystitis. These lawsuits, which allege that ELMIRON\\ncontributes to the development of permanent retinal injury and vision loss, have been filed in both state and federal courts\\nacross the United States. In December 2020, lawsuits filed in federal courts in the United States, including putative class\\n\\n90 • Johnson & Johnson 2022 Annual Report\\n\\n\\x0caction cases seeking medical monitoring, were organized as a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for\\nthe District of New Jersey. In addition, cases have been filed in various state courts of New Jersey, which have been\\ncoordinated in a multi-county litigation in Bergen County, as well as the Court of Common Pleas in Philadelphia, which\\nhave been coordinated and granted mass tort designation. In addition, three class action lawsuits have been filed in\\nCanada. Product liability lawsuits continue to be filed, and the Company continues to receive information with respect to\\npotential costs and the anticipated number of cases. The Company has established accruals for defense and indemnity\\ncosts associated with ELMIRON related product liability litigation.\\n\\nClaims for personal injury have been made against Johnson and Johnson Consumer Inc. (JJCI), arising out of the use of\\nTYLENOL, an over-the-counter pain medication, alleging that prenatal exposure to acetaminophen is associated with the\\ndevelopment of autism spectrum disorder and/or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. In October 2022, lawsuits filed in\\nfederal courts in the United States were organized as a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the\\nSouthern District of New York. In addition, lawsuits have been filed in Canada. Product liability lawsuits continue to be\\nfiled, and the Company continues to receive information with respect to potential costs and the anticipated number of\\ncases. The Company has established accruals for defense costs associated with TYLENOL related product liability\\nlitigation.\\n\\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\\n\\nCertain subsidiaries of the Company are subject, from time to time, to legal proceedings and claims related to patent,\\ntrademark and other intellectual property matters arising out of their businesses. Many of these matters involve challenges\\nto the coverage and/or validity of the patents on various products and allegations that certain of the Company’s products\\ninfringe the patents of third parties. Although these subsidiaries believe that they have substantial defenses to these\\nchallenges and allegations with respect to all significant patents, there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these\\nmatters. A loss in any of these cases could adversely affect the ability of these subsidiaries to sell their products, result in\\nloss of sales due to loss of market exclusivity, require the payment of past damages and future royalties, and may result in\\na non-cash impairment charge for any associated intangible asset. Significant matters are described below.\\n\\nMedTech\\n\\nIn August 2018, Intuitive Surgical, Inc. and Intuitive Surgical Operations, Inc. (collectively, Intuitive) filed a patent\\ninfringement suit against Auris Health, Inc. (Auris) in United States District Court for the District of Delaware. In the suit,\\nIntuitive alleges willful infringement of U.S. Patent Nos. 6,522,906 (’906); 6,800,056 (’056); 8,142,447 (’447); and\\n9,452,276 (’276) based on Auris’ MONARCH Platform. Auris filed IPR Petitions with the U.S. Patent and Trademark\\nOffice (USPTO) regarding the ’056, ’447, ’276 and ’906 patents. In December 2019, the USPTO denied review of the\\n’056 patent. In February and March 2020, the USPTO instituted review of the ’447, and ’906 patents and denied review\\nof the ’276 patent. In March 2021, the USPTO ruled that the challenged claims of the ’447 and ’906 patents are not\\ninvalid. Auris appealed, and in April 2022, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit vacated the decision\\nthat the ’447 patent was not invalid and remanded the decision to the USPTO for further review.

These ANDAs typically include allegations of non-infringement and invalidity of the applicable\\npatents. The Inter Partes Review (IPR) process with the USPTO, created under the 2011 America Invents Act, is also\\nbeing used at times by generic companies in conjunction with ANDAs and lawsuits, to challenge the applicable patents. In\\nthe event the Company’s subsidiaries are not successful in an action, or the automatic statutory stay of the ANDAs expires\\nbefore the United States District Court rulings are obtained, the generic companies involved would have the ability, upon\\napproval of the U.S. FDA, to introduce generic versions of their products to the market, resulting in the potential for\\nsubstantial market share and revenue losses for the applicable products, and which may result in a non-cash impairment\\ncharge in any associated intangible asset. In addition, from time to time, the Company’s subsidiaries may settle these types\\nof actions and such settlements can involve the introduction of generic versions of the products at issue to the market\\nprior to the expiration of the relevant patents.\\n\\nZYTIGA\\n\\nBeginning in January 2019, Janssen Inc., Janssen Oncology, Inc., and BTG International Ltd.

Such regulation has been the basis of government investigations and litigations.\\nThe most significant litigation brought by, and investigations conducted by, government agencies are listed below. It is\\npossible that criminal charges and substantial fines and/or civil penalties or damages could result from government\\ninvestigations or litigation.\\n\\nJohnson & Johnson 2022 Annual Report • 97\\n\\n\\x0cAverage Wholesale Price (AWP) Litigation\\n\\nThe Company and several of its pharmaceutical subsidiaries (the J&J AWP Defendants), along with numerous other\\npharmaceutical companies, were named as defendants in a series of lawsuits in state and federal courts involving\\nallegations that the pricing and marketing of certain pharmaceutical products amounted to fraudulent and otherwise\\nactionable conduct because, among other things, the companies allegedly reported an inflated Average Wholesale Price\\n(AWP) for the drugs at issue. Payors alleged that they used those AWPs in calculating provider reimbursement levels. The\\nplaintiffs in these cases included three classes of private persons or entities that paid for any portion of the purchase of\\nthe drugs at issue based on AWP, and state government entities that made Medicaid payments for the drugs at issue\\nbased on AWP. Many of these cases, both federal actions and state actions removed to federal court, were consolidated\\nfor pre-trial purposes in a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, where\\nall claims against the J&J AWP Defendants were ultimately dismissed. The J&J AWP Defendants also prevailed in a case\\nbrought by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Other AWP cases have been resolved through court order or settlement.\\nThe case brought by Illinois was settled after trial. In New Jersey, a putative class action based upon AWP allegations is\\npending against Centocor, Inc. and Ortho Biotech Inc. (both now Janssen Biotech, Inc.), the Company and ALZA\\nCorporation. All other cases have been resolved.\\n\\nOpioid Litigation\\n\\nBeginning in 2014 and continuing to the present, the Company and Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (JPI), along with other\\npharmaceutical companies, have been named in close to 3,500 lawsuits related to the marketing of opioids, including\\nDURAGESIC, NUCYNTA and NUCYNTA ER. The suits also raise allegations related to previously owned active\\npharmaceutical ingredient supplier subsidiaries, Tasmanian Alkaloids Pty, Ltd. and Noramco, Inc. (both subsidiaries were\\ndivested in 2016). The majority of the cases have been filed by state and local governments. Similar lawsuits have also\\nbeen filed by private plaintiffs and organizations, including but not limited to the following: individual plaintiffs on behalf of\\nchildren born with Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome; hospitals; and health insurers/payors. To date, complaints against\\npharmaceutical manufacturers, including the Company and JPI, have been filed by the state Attorneys General in\\nArkansas, Florida, Idaho, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New\\nMexico, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas, Washington and West Virginia. Complaints against the\\nmanufacturers also have been filed in state or federal court by city, county and local government agencies in every state\\nbut Alaska. The Government of Puerto Rico filed suit in Superior Court of San Juan.\\n\\nThe Company, JPI and other pharmaceutical companies had also received subpoenas or requests for information related\\nto opioids marketing practices from the following state Attorneys General: Alaska, Indiana, Montana, New Hampshire,\\nSouth Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Washington. In September 2017, the Company and JPI were contacted by the\\nTexas and Colorado Attorney General’s Offices on behalf of approximately 38 states regarding a multi-state Attorney\\nGeneral investigation.\\n\\nIn 2019, the trial in the matter filed by the Oklahoma Attorney General resulted in a judgment against the Company and JPI\\nin the amount of $465 million. The Company and JPI appealed the judgment, and in November 2021, the Oklahoma\\nSupreme Court reversed the trial court’s judgment and directed entry of judgment for Defendants. In October 2019 the\\nCompany and JPI announced a settlement of the first case set for trial in the MDL with two counties in Ohio. In April 2021,\\nthree California counties and the City of Oakland commenced a trial in California state court against the Company and JPI,\\nand other affiliates, as well as three other pharmaceutical manufacturers. The trial concluded in October 2021, and in\\nDecember 2021, the Court entered a final trial judgment in favor of Defendants on all claims. In February 2022, Plaintiffs’\\nmotion to set aside and vacate the judgment was denied. Plaintiffs appealed the judgment, but later filed a request to\\ndismiss the appeal after electing to participate in the national settlement agreement.\\n\\nIn October 2019, the Company announced a proposed agreement in principle that would include the Company paying\\n$4 billion as settlement of these matters that had not been tried or settled. In October 2020, the Company agreed to\\ncontribute up to an additional $1 billion to an all-in settlement amount that would resolve opioid lawsuits filed and future\\nclaims by states, cities, counties and tribal governments, for a total of $5 billion which has been accrued, subject to\\nvarious conditions and an agreement being finalized. This agreement is not an admission of liability or wrong-doing. In\\nJuly 2021, the Company announced that the terms of the agreement to settle the state and subdivision claims had been\\nfinalized and approximately half of the all-in settlement was expected to be paid by the end of fiscal year 2022, depending\\nupon the level of participation by the states and their subdivisions. The terms provided a period of time for states to elect\\nto participate in the agreement and, thereafter, a period for the subdivisions of the participating states to opt-in. Based on\\nexpected participation, the Company committed in advance to proceed with the settlement in five of the participating\\nstates (New York, Texas, Florida, Nevada, and New Mexico) and with tribal governments. By late February 2022, 45 states,\\n\\n98 • Johnson & Johnson 2022 Annual Report\\n\\n\\x0cfive territories, the District of Columbia, and the vast majority of eligible subdivisions had elected to participate in the\\nsettlement, and the Company confirmed that the level of participation was sufficient to proceed with the agreement as to\\nall participants. The agreement was effective in April 2022. Also in April 2022, the Company entered into settlement\\nagreements with the states of Alabama and West Virginia and their participating subdivisions. In July 2022, the Company\\nreached a settlement agreement with all litigating Oklahoma subdivisions, and in September 2022, the Company settled\\nwith the State of New Hampshire and its participating subdivisions. Consequently, by the end of the fiscal year 2022, the\\nCompany had settled the opioid claims advanced by all states except Washington.\\n\\nThere are approximately 60 cases remaining post-settlement in various state courts. There are approximately 570\\nremaining federal cases against the Company and JPI coordinated in a federal Multi-District Litigation (MDL) pending in\\nthe U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, and approximately 20 additional cases pending against the\\nCompany and JPI in other federal courts. In addition, the Province of British Columbia filed suit against the Company and\\nits Canadian affiliate Janssen Inc., and many other industry members, in Canada, and is seeking to have that action\\ncertified as an opt in class action on behalf of other provincial/territorial and the federal governments in Canada. Additional\\nproposed class actions have been filed in Canada against the Company and Janssen Inc., and many other industry\\nmembers, by and on behalf of people who used opioids (for personal injuries), municipalities and First Nations bands. In\\nOctober 2019, an antitrust complaint was filed by private plaintiffs in federal court in Tennessee and is pending transfer to\\nthe MDL. These actions allege a variety of claims related to opioid marketing practices, including false advertising, unfair\\ncompetition, public nuisance, consumer fraud violations, deceptive acts and practices, false claims and unjust enrichment.\\nThe suits generally seek penalties and/or injunctive and monetary relief and, in some of the suits, the plaintiffs are seeking\\njoint and several liability among the defendants. An adverse judgment in any of these lawsuits could result in the imposition\\nof large monetary penalties and significant damages including, punitive damages, cost of abatement, substantial fines,\\nequitable remedies and other sanctions.\\n\\nIn August 2019, the Company received a grand jury subpoena from the United States Attorney’s Office for the Eastern\\nDistrict of New York for documents related to the Company’s anti-diversion policies and procedures and distribution of its\\nopioid medications, in what the Company understands to be part of a broader investigation into manufacturers’ and\\ndistributors’ monitoring programs and reporting under the Controlled Substances Act.\\n\\nFrom June 2017 through December 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors received a series of shareholder demand\\nletters alleging breaches of fiduciary duties related to the marketing of opioids. The Board retained independent counsel to\\ninvestigate the allegations in the demands, and in April 2020, independent counsel delivered a report to the Board\\nrecommending that the Company reject the shareholder demands and take the steps that are necessary or appropriate to\\nsecure dismissal of related derivative litigation. The Board unanimously adopted the recommendations of the independent\\ncounsel’s report.\\n\\nIn November 2019, one of the shareholders who sent a demand filed a derivative complaint against the Company as the\\nnominal defendant and certain current and former directors and officers as defendants in the Superior Court of New\\nJersey. The complaint alleges breaches of fiduciary duties related to the marketing of opioids, and that the Company has\\nsuffered damages as a result of those alleged breaches. A series of additional derivative complaints making similar\\nallegations against the same and similar defendants were filed in New Jersey state and federal courts in 2019 and 2020.\\nBy 2022, all but two state court cases had been voluntarily dismissed. In February 2022, the state court granted the\\nCompany’s motion to dismiss one of the two cases, and the shareholder that brought the second case filed a notice of\\ndismissal. The shareholder whose complaint was dismissed filed a motion for reconsideration. In May 2022, the state court\\nheld oral argument on the motion for reconsideration and subsequently denied the motion. The shareholder has appealed\\nthe state court’s dismissal order.\\n\\nOther\\n\\nIn August 2012, DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc., DePuy, Inc. (now known as DePuy Synthes, Inc.), and Johnson & Johnson\\nServices, Inc. (collectively DePuy) received an informal request from the United States Attorney’s Office for the District of\\nMassachusetts and the Civil Division of the United States Department of Justice (the United States) for the production of\\nmaterials relating to the DePuy ASR XL Hip device. In July 2014, the United States notified the United States District\\nCourt for the District of Massachusetts that it had declined to intervene in a qui tam case filed pursuant to the False Claims\\nAct against the companies concerning the hip devices. In February 2016, the District Court granted the companies’\\nmotion to dismiss with prejudice, unsealed the qui tam complaint, and denied the qui tam relators’ request for leave to file a\\nfurther amended complaint. The qui tam relators appealed the case to the United States Court of Appeals for the First\\nCircuit. In July 2017, the First Circuit affirmed the District Court’s dismissal in part, reversed in part, and affirmed the\\ndecision to deny the relators’ request to file a third amended complaint. In March 2021, DePuy filed its motion to strike and\\n\\nJohnson & Johnson 2022 Annual Report • 99\\n\\n\\x0cdismiss the relators’ second amended complaint; the District Court denied DePuy’s motion to strike and dismiss in\\nJuly 2021. DePuy filed a motion for reconsideration of the District Court’s July 2021 ruling. In November 2021, the District\\nCourt granted DePuy’s motion for reconsideration and dismissed the case with prejudice. The District Court’s order was\\nunsealed in December 2021. The relators filed several post-dismissal motions, including a January 2022 omnibus motion\\nfor reconsideration, which the District Court denied. Following the District Court’s order dismissing the case with\\nprejudice, DePuy filed a December 2021 motion seeking the recovery of attorneys’ fees and costs, which the District\\nCourt denied except as to costs. The Relators have appealed the District Court’s dismissal of the case to the First Circuit.\\nThe briefing on the appeal is complete, the First Circuit held oral argument on December 6, 2022, and the First Circuit’s\\ndecision remains pending.\\n\\nIn October 2012, the Company was contacted by the California Attorney General’s office regarding a multi-state Attorney\\nGeneral investigation of the marketing of surgical mesh products for hernia and urogynecological purposes by the\\nCompany’s subsidiary, Ethicon, Inc. (Ethicon). In May 2016, California and Washington filed civil complaints against the\\nCompany, Ethicon and Ethicon US, LLC alleging violations of their consumer protection statutes. Similar complaints were\\nfiled against the companies by the following states: Kentucky, Mississippi, West Virginia and Oregon. In April 2019, the\\nCompany and Ethicon settled the Washington case. In October 2019, the Company and Ethicon settled the multi-state\\ninvestigation with 41 other states and the District of Columbia. In April 2020, the Company settled the West Virginia case.\\nIn October 2020, the Company settled with the Attorney General of Oregon. In November 2020, the Company settled\\nwith the Attorney General of Mississippi. Trial in the Kentucky matter is scheduled for June 2023. The California case\\nstarted trial in July 2019 and concluded in September 2019. In January 2020, the Court in California issued a statement of\\ndecision, finding in favor of the State of California, and awarded civil penalties in the amount of $344 million. In April 2020,\\nthe Court in California denied the Company’s motion for a new trial. In August 2020, the Court entered judgment with\\nrespect to the penalties of $344 million, but denied the Attorney General’s request for injunctive relief. The Company\\nappealed the penalty judgment. In April 2022, the Court of Appeals reduced the judgment to $302 million, but otherwise\\ndenied the appeal. In July 2022, the Supreme Court of California denied the Company’s petition to review the Court of\\nAppeals decision, and the Company recorded a charge to reflect the judgment in the second quarter of 2022. In\\nNovember 2022, the Company petitioned the United States Supreme Court for review.\\n\\nIn June 2014, the Mississippi Attorney General filed a complaint in Chancery Court of The First Judicial District of Hinds\\nCounty, Mississippi against the Company and Johnson & Johnson Consumer Companies, Inc. (now known as Johnson &\\nJohnson Consumer Inc.) (collectively, JJCI). The complaint alleges that JJCI violated the Mississippi Consumer Protection\\nAct by failing to disclose alleged health risks associated with female consumers’ use of talc contained in JOHNSON’S\\nBaby Powder and JOHNSON’S Shower to Shower (a product divested in 2012) and seeks injunctive and monetary relief.\\nThe Company and JJCI moved for summary judgment on the grounds that the State’s claim was barred by preemption,\\nwhich the trial court denied. The Mississippi Supreme Court granted the Company and JJCI’s request to file an\\ninterlocutory appeal of the denial of the motion for summary judgment in late 2019. Briefing and oral argument were\\ncompleted. Thereafter, the Court rejected the interlocutory appeal in April 2021 and remanded the matter to the trial court.\\nIn August 2021, JJCI filed a Petition for Writ of Certiorari in the United States Supreme Court as to the Mississippi\\nSupreme Court’s ruling of April 2021. In December 2021 the United States Supreme Court denied the Petition for Writ of\\nCertiorari. After the Mississippi Supreme Court remanded the matter to the trial court, the State moved for a trial setting.\\nJJCI objected to any trial setting as barred by the stay arising from the LTL Bankruptcy Case, referenced above, while the\\nState argued that the stay did not apply. In January 2022, the Court granted the State’s motion for trial setting and\\ndirected the parties to consult with the Court administrator to secure a trial date. In February 2022, the trial court set the\\ncase for trial to begin in February 2023. However, given the efforts to resolve talc-related claims in the LTL Bankruptcy\\nCase, the Company and the State agreed to a temporary stay of discovery until May 2022. The temporary stay expired in\\nMay 2022. LTL thereafter moved to enjoin prosecution of the case in the LTL Bankruptcy Case. In October 2022, the\\nbankruptcy court issued an order staying the case. The State filed an appeal to the Third Circuit concerning the stay order.\\n\\nIn January 2020, the State of New Mexico filed a consumer protection case alleging that the Company deceptively\\nmarketed and sold its talcum powder products by making misrepresentations about the safety of the products and the\\npresence of carcinogens, including asbestos. The State of New Mexico filed an Amended Complaint in March 2020. The\\nCompany moved to dismiss certain of the claims in the Amended Complaint, which was granted. The Company then filed\\na motion for partial judgment on the pleadings in December 2020, which was denied. In March 2022, the New Mexico\\ncourt denied the Company’s motion to compel the State of New Mexico to engage in discovery of state agencies and\\ndenied the Company’s request for interlocutory appeal of that decision. The Company then filed a Petition for Writ of\\nSuperintending Control and a Request for a Stay to the New Mexico Supreme Court on the issue of the State of\\nNew Mexico’s discovery obligations. In April 2022, in view of the efforts to resolve talc-related claims in the LTL\\nBankruptcy Case, the Company and the State agreed to a 60-day stay of all matters except for the pending writ before the\\n\\n100 • Johnson & Johnson 2022 Annual Report\\n\\n\\x0cNew Mexico Supreme Court, which expired in June 2022. Thereafter, the Company moved to enjoin prosecution of the\\ncase in the LTL Bankruptcy Case. In October 2022, the bankruptcy court issued an order staying the case. In December\\n2022, the State filed an appeal to the Third Circuit concerning the stay order. Separately, in September 2022, the\\nNew Mexico Supreme Court granted the Company’s request for a stay pending further briefing on the scope of the State\\nof New Mexico’s discovery obligations.\\n\\nForty-two states and the District of Columbia have commenced a joint investigation into the Company’s marketing of its\\ntalcum powder products. At this time, the multi-state group has not asserted any claims against the Company. Five states\\nhave issued Civil Investigative Demands seeking documents and other information. The Company has produced\\ndocuments to Arizona, North Carolina, Texas, and Washington and entered into confidentiality agreements. The Company\\nhas not received any follow up requests from those states. In March 2022, each of the forty-two states (including\\nMississippi and New Mexico) agreed to mediation of their claims in the LTL Bankruptcy Case. In July 2022, New Mexico\\nand Mississippi indicated they would no longer voluntarily submit to further mediation in the LTL Bankruptcy and would\\nproceed with their respective cases in state court. LTL moved the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court for an order staying\\nfurther proceedings in those two actions, which the Bankruptcy Court granted in October 2022. In December 2022, the\\nBankruptcy Court allowed New Mexico and Mississippi to file a direct appeal of its stay.\\n\\nIn July 2016, the Company and Janssen Products, LP were served with a qui tam complaint pursuant to the False Claims\\nAct filed in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey alleging the off-label promotion of two HIV\\nproducts, PREZISTA and INTELENCE, and anti-kickback violations in connection with the promotion of these products.\\nThe complaint was filed under seal in December 2012.

We also have audited the\\nCompany’s internal control over financial reporting as of January 1, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control -\\nIntegrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission\\n(COSO).\\n\\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial\\nposition of the Company as of January 1, 2023 and January 2, 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows\\nfor each of the three fiscal years in the period ended January 1, 2023 in conformity with accounting principles generally\\naccepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective\\ninternal control over financial reporting as of January 1, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated\\nFramework (2013) issued by the COSO.\\n\\nBasis for Opinions\\n\\nThe Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal\\ncontrol over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting,\\nincluded in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to\\nexpress opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company’s internal control over financial\\nreporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight\\nBoard (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the\\nU.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the\\nPCAOB.\\n\\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\\nperform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material\\nmisstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained\\nin all material respects.\\n\\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material\\nmisstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that\\nrespond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and\\ndisclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used\\nand significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial\\nstatements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control\\nover financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and\\noperating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other\\nprocedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for\\nour opinions.\\n\\nAs described in Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, management has excluded Abiomed,\\nInc., (“Abiomed”) from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of January 1, 2023, because it was\\nacquired by the Company in a business combination during 2022. We have also excluded Abiomed from our audit of\\ninternal control over financial reporting. Abiomed is a wholly-owned subsidiary whose total assets and total sales excluded\\nfrom management’s assessment and our audit of internal control over financial reporting represent less than 1% of each of\\nthe related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the fiscal year ended January 1, 2023.\\n\\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\\n\\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the\\nreliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with\\n\\nJohnson & Johnson 2022 Annual Report • 105\\n\\n\\x0cgenerally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and\\nprocedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the\\ntransactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are\\nrecorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting\\nprinciples, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of\\nmanagement and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection\\nof unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial\\nstatements.\\n\\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,\\nprojections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate\\nbecause of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\\n\\nCritical Audit Matters\\n\\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated\\nfinancial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to\\naccounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially\\nchallenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our\\nopinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit\\nmatters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they\\nrelate.\\n\\nU.S. Pharmaceutical Rebate Reserves - Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid\\n\\nAs described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recognizes revenue from product sales\\nwhen obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied. Rebates and discounts provided to\\ncustomers are accounted for as variable consideration and recorded as a reduction in sales. The liability for such rebates\\nand discounts is recognized within Accrued Rebates, Returns, and Promotions on the consolidated balance sheet. A\\nsignificant portion of the liability related to rebates is from the sale of pharmaceutical goods within the U.S., primarily the\\nManaged Care, Medicare and Medicaid programs, which amounted to $9.6 billion as of January 1, 2023. For significant\\nrebate programs, which include the U.S. Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid rebate programs, rebates and discounts\\nestimated by management are based on contractual terms, historical experience, patient outcomes, trend analysis, and\\nprojected market conditions in the U.S. pharmaceutical market.\\n\\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to U.S. pharmaceutical rebate\\nreserves — Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management\\ndue to the significant measurement uncertainty involved in developing these reserves and the high degree of auditor\\njudgment, subjectivity and audit effort in performing procedures and evaluating the assumptions related to contractual\\nterms, historical experience, patient outcomes, trend analysis, and projected market conditions in the U.S. pharmaceutical\\nmarket.\\n\\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our\\noverall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls\\nrelating to U.S. pharmaceutical rebate reserves — Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid, including controls over the\\nassumptions used to estimate these rebates. These procedures also included, among others, (i) developing an\\nindependent estimate of the rebates by utilizing third party information on price and market conditions in the U.S.\\npharmaceutical market, the terms of the specific rebate programs, and the historical experience and trend analysis of\\nactual rebate claims paid; (ii) testing rebate claims processed by the Company, including evaluating those claims for\\nconsistency with the contractual and mandated terms of the Company’s rebate arrangements; and (iii) comparing the\\nindependent estimates to management’s estimates.\\n\\nLitigation Contingencies - Talc\\n\\nAs described in Notes 1 and 19 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company records accruals for loss\\ncontingencies associated with legal matters, including talc, when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the\\namount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. To the extent adverse awards, judgments, or verdicts have been rendered\\nagainst the Company, management does not record an accrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be\\nreasonably estimated. For these matters, management is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond the\\n\\n106 • Johnson & Johnson 2022 Annual Report\\n\\n\\x0camounts accrued. Amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of judgments about future\\nevents and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions including timing of related payments. The ability to\\nmake such estimates and judgments can be affected by various factors, including, among other things, whether damages\\nsought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; scientific and legal discovery has not commenced or is\\nnot complete; proceedings are in early stages; matters present legal uncertainties; there are significant facts in dispute;\\nprocedural or jurisdictional issues; the uncertainty and unpredictability of the number of potential claims; ability to achieve\\ncomprehensive multi-party settlements; complexity of related cross-claims and counterclaims; and/or there are numerous\\nparties involved. Management continues to believe that the Company has strong legal grounds to contest the talc verdicts\\nit has appealed. Notwithstanding management’s confidence in the safety of the Company’s talc products, in certain\\ncircumstances the Company has settled cases. In October 2021, Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc. (Old JJCI), a wholly-\\nowned subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson, implemented a corporate restructuring and created a subsidiary, LTL\\nManagement LLC (LTL), which became solely responsible for the talc-related liabilities, and another subsidiary, New JJCI,\\nwhich became responsible for the remaining business of Old JJCI. LTL filed a voluntary petition, seeking relief under\\nchapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. As a result of the LTL bankruptcy case, the Court entered a temporary restraining\\norder staying all litigation against LTL and Old JJCI. On November 15, 2021, the North Carolina Bankruptcy Court\\nconfirmed the scope of the stay, issuing a Preliminary Injunction (PI) prohibiting and enjoining the commencement and\\nprosecution of talc-related claims against LTL, Old JJCI, New JJCI, Johnson & Johnson, other of their corporate affiliates,\\nidentified retailers, insurance companies, and certain other parties. The LTL Bankruptcy Case was transferred to the\\nUnited States Bankruptcy Court for the District of New Jersey in November 2021, and that court extended the PI through\\nthe end of February 2022. Claimants filed motions to dismiss the LTL Bankruptcy Case and, following a multiple day\\nhearing, the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court denied those motions by order issued in March 2022. The New Jersey\\nBankruptcy Court simultaneously issued another order extending the stay as to the Protected Parties. The claimants\\nsubsequently filed notices of appeal as to the denial of the motions to dismiss and the extension of the stay. In May\\n2022,the Third Circuit Court of Appeals granted the petitions to appeal. The briefing and oral argument on the appeal\\nwere completed in September 2022. On January 30, 2023, the Third Circuit reversed the Bankruptcy Court’s ruling and\\nremanded to the Bankruptcy Court to dismiss the LTL bankruptcy. LTL has filed a petition for rehearing on the decision.\\n\\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the talc litigation is a critical audit\\nmatter are the significant judgment by management when assessing the likelihood of a loss being incurred and when\\ndetermining whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or range of loss for the future and existing talc claims can be made,\\nwhich in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating\\nmanagement’s assessment of the loss contingencies associated with this litigation.\\n\\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our\\noverall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls\\nrelating to management’s evaluation of the talc litigation, including controls over determining whether a loss is probable\\nand whether the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, as well as financial statement disclosures. These\\nprocedures also included, among others, (i) gaining an understanding of the Company’s process around the accounting\\nand reporting for the talc litigation; (ii) discussing the status of significant known actual and potential litigation and the\\nongoing LTL bankruptcy proceedings with the Company’s in-house legal counsel, as well as external counsel when\\ndeemed necessary; (iii) obtaining and evaluating the letters of audit inquiry with internal and external legal counsel for\\nsignificant litigation; (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of management’s assessment regarding whether an unfavorable\\noutcome is reasonably possible or probable and reasonably estimable; and (v) evaluating the sufficiency of the Company’s\\nlitigation contingencies disclosures.\\n\\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\\n\\nFlorham Park, New Jersey\\nFebruary 16, 2023\\n\\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since at least 1920.

The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance as to the\\nreliability of the Company’s financial reporting and the preparation of external financial statements in accordance with\\ngenerally accepted accounting principles.\\n\\nInternal controls over financial reporting, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, internal control\\nover financial reporting determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial\\nstatement preparation and may not prevent or detect all misstatements. Moreover, projections of any evaluation of\\neffectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in\\nconditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\\n\\nThe Company’s management has assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as\\nof January 1, 2023. In making this assessment, the Company used the criteria established by the Committee of\\nSponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in “Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013).”\\nThese criteria are in the areas of control environment, risk assessment, control activities, information and communication,\\nand monitoring. The Company’s assessment included extensive documenting, evaluating and testing the design and\\noperating effectiveness of its internal controls over financial reporting.\\n\\nThe Company acquired Abiomed, Inc. (Abiomed), in a business combination in December 2022. Abiomed’s total assets,\\nexcluding intangible assets and goodwill, and total sales represented less than 1% of each of the related consolidated\\nfinancial statement amounts as of and for the fiscal year ended January 1, 2023. As the acquisition occurred in the fiscal\\nyear 2022, the scope of the Company’s assessment of the design and effectiveness of internal control over financial\\nreporting for the fiscal year 2022 excluded the above mentioned acquisition. This exclusion is in accordance with the\\nSEC’s general guidance that an assessment of a recently acquired business may be omitted from the scope in the year of\\nacquisition.\\n\\nBased on the Company’s processes and assessment, as described above, management has concluded that, as of\\nJanuary 1, 2023, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective.\\n\\nThe effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of January 1, 2023 has been audited by\\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which appears\\nherein.\\n\\n/s/ J.

Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and\\nprocedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or\\nsubmits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its principal\\nexecutive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions\\nregarding required disclosure. Joaquin Duato, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Joseph J. Wolk, Executive Vice\\nPresident, Chief Financial Officer, reviewed and participated in this evaluation. Based on this evaluation, Messrs. Duato\\nand Wolk concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Report, the Company’s disclosure controls and\\nprocedures were effective.\\n\\nReports on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. The information called for by this item is incorporated herein by\\nreference to “Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting”, and the attestation regarding internal\\ncontrols over financial reporting included in the “Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm” included in\\nItem 8 of this Report.\\n\\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. During the fiscal quarter ended January 1, 2023, there were no\\nchanges in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required\\nunder Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to\\nmaterially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. The Company continues to monitor and assess\\nthe effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures.\\n\\nThe Company is implementing a multi-year, enterprise-wide initiative to integrate, simplify and standardize processes and\\nsystems for the human resources, information technology, procurement, supply chain and finance functions. These are\\nenhancements to support the growth of the Company’s financial shared service capabilities and standardize financial\\nsystems. This initiative is not in response to any identified deficiency or weakness in the Company’s internal control over\\nfinancial reporting. In response to this initiative, the Company has and will continue to align and streamline the design and\\noperation of its financial control environment.\\n\\nItem 9B.

Pfizer has always had a noble \\n\\npurpose rooted in our commitment to patients, \\n\\nbut we wanted to make our purpose more \\n\\nmemorable, more inspiring and, most important, \\n\\nmore actionable. \\n\\nI am happy to say that in the 50 months since \\n\\nthen, Pfizer’s more than 80,000 colleagues \\n\\naround the world have lived this purpose every \\n\\nday. They have pursued impactful breakthroughs \\n\\nwith the goal of dramatically changing the lives \\n\\nof patients for the better. As a result of this \\n\\nunwavering commitment to innovation and \\n\\npatients, 2022 was a simply remarkable year for \\n\\nour company on multiple fronts.\\n\\n•  We secured eight key regulatory approvals, \\n\\ncompleted 13 regulatory submissions and \\n\\ninitiated 10 pivotal study starts, as we \\n\\ncontinue to advance our robust R&D pipeline \\n\\nof potential breakthrough medicines and \\n\\nvaccines.\\n\\n•  We maintained our industry-leading clinical \\nsuccess ratesi and further improved our \\ncycle times, which already were among the \\nindustry’s best,ii and we did all of this while \\nmaintaining our high standards of quality, \\n\\nsafety, and scientific rigor. \\n\\n•  We completed four acquisitions—Arena \\n\\nPharmaceuticals, Biohaven Pharmaceuticals, \\n\\nGlobal Blood Therapeutics, and ReViral—\\n\\nwhich have further strengthened both \\n\\n•  We were named to 10 different “best \\n\\nemployer” lists, including those published by \\n\\nForbes, LinkedIn, Glassdoor, and others. \\n\\n•  We exceeded $100 billion in revenues for the \\n\\nfirst time in our 174-year history.\\n\\n•  And, most important, more than 1.3 billion \\n\\npatients around the world were treated \\nwith our medicines and vaccines.iii A truly \\nhumbling achievement.\\n\\nMaintaining Our COVID–19 \\nLeadership\\n\\nDuring the year, we also continued to lead the \\n\\nbattle against COVID-19. As the virus continued \\n\\nto evolve, Pfizer scientists were up to the \\n\\nchallenge—using our flexible mRNA platform \\n\\nto swiftly create a new vaccine candidate \\n\\nbased on the emerging Omicron BA.4 and BA.5 \\n\\nsubvariants. By September, our BA.4/BA.5-\\n\\nadapted bivalent vaccine had been authorized \\n\\nby both the U.S. Food and Drug Administration \\n\\n(FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) \\n\\nas a booster dose for ages 12 years and older. By \\nNovember, both agencies had authorized it for \\n\\n5 years of age and older. Then in December, the \\n\\nOmicron BA.4/BA.5-adapted bivalent COVID-19 \\n\\nvaccine received FDA authorization as the third \\n\\n3-µg dose in the three-dose primary series for \\n\\nchildren 6 months through 4 years of age. \\n\\nWe are proud to have maintained our leadership \\n\\nposition throughout the public health booster \\n\\ni\\n\\nii\\n\\niii\\n\\n4\\n\\nSuccess rates for Phase 1 are based on a 3-year rolling average (2020-2022); rates for Phase 2 and Phase 3/Registration represent a 5-year rolling average (2018-2022).\\n\\nFirst in Human (FIH) to approval median phase cycle times are based on 3-year rolling cohort for Phase 1 and 5-year rolling cohort for Phase 2 to Registration. The analysis is at the new \\nmolecular entity (NME) level. Industry-leading is defined as Top Quartile amongst peer group companies.\\n\\nThe patients treated metric is calculated from Pfizer and third-party datasets. Figures may be limited given the coverage provided by external sources (e.g., calendar duration, \\ngeographic and product coverage). Numbers are estimates and in some cases use global volume, daily dosage and number of treatment days to facilitate calculations. Methodologies \\nto calculate estimates may vary by product type given the nature of the product and available data. Patients taking multiple Pfizer products may be counted as multiple patients \\ntowards total. Numbers include estimated patient counts from U.S. Patient Assistance Programs, ex-U.S. access & affordability programs, product donations and Global Commercial \\nAccess Partnerships (this does not include An Accord for a Healthier World). Historical estimates may periodically be subject to revision due to restatements in the underlying data \\nsource. \\n\\nA Letter From Our Chairman & CEO\\n\\nPfizer 2022 Annual Review \\n\\x0cA Year In Review\\n\\n2022 Stories\\n\\nESG\\n\\nPerformance\\n\\nAbout This Review\\n\\ncampaign. As of February 22, 2023, we held a 64% market share of \\nbivalent boosters in the U.S.iv—which is a significant expansion on \\nthe booster share leadership position that we already held before \\n\\nanother key element of the Accord is collaborating with global \\n\\nhealth leaders to make improvements in diagnosis, education, \\n\\ninfrastructure, innovative financing, and more.

As of \\nMarch 1, 2023, we have shipped 44 million treatment courses to 63 \\n\\ncountries around the world.\\n\\nLeading the Charge for Equitable Access\\n\\nHere in the U.S., I’m equally proud of the important work being \\n\\ndone by Pfizer’s Multicultural Health Equity Collective, which \\n\\nrecently convened more than 100 health equity luminaries from \\n\\nacross the U.S. to engage in candid conversations about the \\n\\ndrivers and impact of systemic racism on healthcare. The dialogue \\n\\nhighlighted creative solutions that are already starting to reduce \\n\\nhealth disparities in local communities across the country.\\n\\nA Bright Future for Pfizer and for Patients\\n\\nLooking ahead, Pfizer’s future appears to be even brighter than \\n\\nour present. We’re in the midst of an 18-month period during \\n\\nwhich we expect to have up to an unprecedented 19 new products \\n\\nDuring the year, we also took bold action to help ensure our \\n\\nor indications in the market.

The disease causes irritation and \\nulcers on the inner lining of the large intestine. It is one of a \\ngroup of diseases called inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). \\nSigns of ulcerative colitis often present as recurring diarrhea, \\nwhich may contain blood, mucus or pus, abdominal pain, \\nand urgency amongst further symptoms. UC is associated \\nwith lower patient quality of life that is comparable to other \\nserious chronic conditions and is worse in inadequately \\ncontrolled patients. Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) modulates \\nthe inflammatory pathway by regulating the egress of \\nlymphocytes from lymph nodes, and lymphocytes have a \\npivotal role in the pathogenesis of inflammation in patients \\nwith IBD.3 Etrasimod, a once-daily, oral, S1P receptor \\nmodulator selectively activates S1P receptor subtypes 1, 4, and \\n5, which are believed to be involved in modulating the body\\'s \\nimmune response by limiting movement of lymphocytes to \\nsites of inflammation, while avoiding S1P receptors (S1P2,3) \\nassociated with serious AEs.\\n\\nIn May 2022, we announced positive results from our phase \\n3 trials demonstrating potential substantial positive benefits \\nof etrasimod. In the 52-week study, clinical remission was \\n27.0% for patients receiving etrasimod compared to 7.4% \\nfor patients receiving placebo at week 12 and was 32.1% \\ncompared to 6.7% at week 52. In the 12-week study, clinical \\nremission was achieved among 24.8% of patients receiving \\netrasimod compared to 15.2% of patients receiving placebo. \\nSafety findings were consistent with those reported in \\nprevious studies of etrasimod. The most common treatment-\\nemergent AEs in 3% or more of etrasimod-treated patients \\nand greater than placebo up to week 52 in either trial were \\nheadache, worsening of UC, COVID-19 infection, dizziness, \\npyrexia, arthralgia, abdominal pain and nausea. These data \\nwere presented as a late-breaker presentation at Digestive \\nDisease Week (DDW) 2022.4 Additional subgroup analyses \\npresented at United European Gastroenterology Week (UEGW) \\n2022 suggest that etrasimod may be particularly efficacious in \\npatients naïve to or with one prior advanced therapy.5 Many \\n\\npatients living with ulcerative colitis might never achieve or \\nmaintain remission with the currently available treatment \\noptions. If approved by regulatory authorities, etrasimod \\nhas the potential to provide a new once-daily, oral option \\nthat could be an attractive first-line advanced therapy for \\npatients with moderately-to-severely active ulcerative colitis. \\nKey potential differentiators for etrasimod are that the data \\nmay support once-daily oral dosing without a complex dose \\ntitration scheme to start treatment. Lack of titration combined \\nwith its 30 hour half-life provide a fast onset of symptom relief \\nalong with fast offset/washout which can be advantageous in \\nfamily planning and when the rate of immune reconstitution is \\ncritical.\\n\\nPfizer researchers are working hard to address the unpleasant \\nsymptoms commonly reported by patients living with ulcerative colitis: \\nrecurring diarrhea, which may contain blood, mucus or pus, and \\nabdominal pain and urgency amongst further symptoms.\\n\\n“Etrasimod could offer a meaningful clinical profile for people \\nliving with moderately-to-severely active ulcerative colitis \\nconsidering the clear benefit it has shown over 52 weeks in \\na treat-through trial design, its mechanism of action, and its \\nunique pharmacologic properties,” said Michael Corbo, Chief \\nDevelopment Officer, Inflammation & Immunology, Pfizer \\nGlobal Product Development. “Patients often need multiple \\noptions to help manage their disease, and there is a significant \\nneed for new therapies. In the ELEVATE clinical program, \\netrasimod has shown an encouraging balance of efficacy and \\nsafety that we believe could have a meaningful impact for \\npatients and physicians if approved.”\\n\\n1   Seyedian SS, Nokhostin F, Malamir MD.

Prostate cancer also \\nhas one of the widest racial disparities of any cancer, and \\nthese disparities are prevalent at every stage of the cancer \\ncontinuum. \\n\\nPfizer’s R&D efforts have led to a robust pipeline where we leverage \\ntherapeutic approaches to benefit patients.\\n\\nFor those diagnosed with prostate cancer, the majority occur \\nin the early stages2, where the disease is considered curable \\nwith definitive therapy, such as surgery or radiation therapy. \\nBut a proportion of patients will progress after definitive \\ntherapy, or worse, be diagnosed at an advanced stage of the \\ndisease. It is often then considered incurable. The median \\noverall survival for patients who have increasing levels of \\nthe protein prostate-specific antigen (PSA) after localized \\ntreatment survive between eight and nine years.3 For those \\nwith a certain type of advanced prostate cancer, known as \\nmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), the \\nprognosis is dire—survival is only about 13 months.4,5 \\n\\nResearch over the past decade has focused on improving \\noutcomes for men with mCRPC, and while advances have \\nbeen made with the introduction of therapies known as novel \\n\\nhormonal therapies (NHTs), some patients eventually develop \\nresistance and are left with no other treatment options.  \\n\\nThis is where Pfizer is aiming to deliver the next scientific \\nbreakthrough.\\n\\nPfizer\\'s R&D efforts have led to a robust pipeline allowing \\nus to explore various therapeutic approaches of potential \\nbenefit to patients in clinical trials. One such trial is the \\nPhase 3 TALAPRO-2 trial which found that the combination of \\nTALZENNA® (talazoparib), our oral poly ADP-ribose polymerase \\n(PARP) inhibitor, with XTANDI®* (enzalutamide) yielded a \\nstatistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement \\nin radiographic progression-free survival compared with \\nplacebo plus XTANDI. Benefits in other key endpoints, such \\nas overall survival, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response, \\ntime to PSA progression, and overall response rate, were also \\nobserved.     \\n\\n“For men with mCRPC, time is especially important, and we \\nwant to give people living with this disease the possibility \\nof more time with their loved ones,” said Chris Boshoff, MD, \\nPhD, Chief Development Officer, Oncology and Rare Disease, \\nPfizer Global Product Development. “If approved, we believe \\nTALZENNA may offer a new treatment option.”\\n\\nTALAPRO-2 is a two-part, two-cohort, multicenter, \\nrandomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 study \\nof 1,095 patients with mCRPC. TALZENNA or the combination \\nof TALZENNA plus XTANDI has not been approved by any \\nregulatory agency for the treatment of mCRPC.\\n\\n“TALAPRO-2 underscores our long-term commitment to men \\nliving with advanced prostate cancer,” said Suneet Varma, \\nGlobal Oncology and U.S. President, Pfizer.“ Based on the \\ncompelling combination data from TALAPRO-2, we believe \\nTALZENNA in prostate cancer may become the next potential \\nblockbuster opportunity in our leading Pfizer Oncology \\nportfolio, subject to regulatory approval.”\\n\\n*Pfizer and Astellas jointly commercialize XTANDI in the United States, and Astellas has responsibility for manufacturing and all additional \\nregulatory filings globally, as well as commercializing XTANDI outside the United States.\\n\\n1   World Cancer Research Fund International.

Even so, by the time cancer has spread to the brain, it \\nis often difficult to treat. \\n\\nThat’s because of the blood-brain barrier, which evolved \\nto block pathogens and toxins from entering the brain and \\ncan also prevent the passage of beneficial medications. \\nLORVIQUA® (lorlatinib), available in the U.S. under the brand \\nname LORBRENA®, is a third-generation medicine developed \\nby Pfizer to treat advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) \\nthat is anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) positive. The drug \\nwas designed to specifically break through the blood-brain \\nbarrier.1 \\n\\nApproximately 25 to 40% of patients with ALK+ NSCLC either \\nhave brain metastases—cancer that has spread to the brain, \\nat baseline, or develop brain metastases within two years of \\ndiagnosis.2 \\n\\nNow, adults with advanced ALK+ NSCLC living in the European \\nUnion (EU) have access to LORVIQUA monotherapy as a first-\\nline treatment under a marketing authorization granted by the \\nEuropean Commission in January 2022. Previously, LORVIQUA \\nwas available in the EU only under a conditional marketing \\nauthorization and only to a subset of patients with advanced \\nALK+ NSCLC whose cancer progressed after earlier ALK-\\ntargeting therapies. \\n\\nLORVIQUA attacks the cancer at its source by tamping down \\nthe activity of the ALK protein, which is altered in ALK+ NSCLC, \\ncausing runaway cell growth.3\\n\\nIn the pivotal Phase 3 head-to-head CROWN clinical trial, ALK+ \\nNSCLC patients who received LORVIQUA had 72% lower risk \\nof progression or death than those who received XALKORI® \\n(crizotinib).4 Importantly, 82% of participants with brain \\n\\nmetastases that could be measured saw their brain tumors \\nshrink or disappear entirely following LORVIQUA treatment, \\ncompared to 23% for XALKORI, which also works by targeting \\nALK protein but with less brain penetration.5 Out of 112 \\npatients who did not have brain metastases when enrolled in \\nthe trial who were treated with LORVIQUA, only one developed \\nbrain metastases.\\n\\nPrecision medicine for lung cancer takes individual biomarkers into \\naccount for treatment decisions. Credit: Pfizer.\\n\\nXALKORI is another Pfizer product and was authorized in the \\nEU as a first-line treatment for ALK+ NSCLC in 2015. But we \\ndidn’t stop there.

Messenger \\nRNA or mRNA is a set of instructions that cells in the body \\nfollow to make specific proteins. Proteins play many essential \\nroles in our bodies, including helping to prevent infections \\nand potentially treat diseases. Many of the advantages of \\nmRNA technology—its flexibility, speed, and potency—have \\nscientists around the globe excited about its potential future \\napplications. \\n\\nThe next wave of scientific innovation is upon us and Pfizer \\nis working hard to harness the power of mRNA. We believe \\nour expertise in disease biology, along with our robust, rapid \\nmanufacturing capabilities and talented scientific minds, will \\nhelp propel the potential of this technology forward. In 2022, \\nwe’ve advanced our work and collaborated with new partners \\nto help realize this incredible technology’s full potential and \\nexpand our ability to leverage this scientific platform beyond \\nCOVID–19.   \\n\\nOur current exploration of mRNA is focused on infectious \\ndiseases with development programs in flu and shingles, as \\nwell as exploring mRNA’s versatility in the areas of rare genetic \\ndiseases. Throughout the past year, we have made significant \\nprogress. \\n\\nInfluenza or Flu\\nFlu continues to cause hospitalizations and deaths across the \\nworld every year, so we recognize an important opportunity \\nto develop a potentially more efficacious vaccine. In 2022, \\nwe started our pivotal Phase 3 studies for an mRNA-based \\ninfluenza vaccine candidate. The ability to nimbly “edit” mRNA \\ncould provide a huge benefit when it comes to vaccines that \\nmust be updated annually. With traditional flu vaccines, \\nscientists try to predict many months in advance which strains \\nmight circulate and match the vaccines to the predicted \\nstrains. mRNA technology could be leveraged to generate \\nvaccines much closer to the onset of each flu season, which \\ncould result in better matches to circulating strains. This \\nflexibility, paired with the ability to rapidly manufacture mRNA \\nvaccines, could potentially allow greater reliability of supply \\nand better strain match, which could lead to improved efficacy.\\n\\nShingles\\nShingles is a debilitating, disfiguring and painful disease that \\naffects people all over the world. In January, we announced a \\n\\ncollaboration with BioNTech to develop a potential first mRNA-\\nbased vaccine for the prevention of shingles. We plan to start \\nhuman studies for this vaccine candidate in 2023.\\n\\nRare genetic diseases\\nWe’ve established a research collaboration with Beam \\nTherapeutics to develop mRNA technology as a potential \\nnew approach to gene editing, which is a form of gene \\ntherapy. Gene editing works by delivering “tools” encased in \\nlipid nanoparticles (fatty bubbles) that have the potential to \\nreplace, remove, or correct faulty genes in patients with rare \\ndiseases—providing a potential one-time treatment for these \\ndebilitating conditions. Our work is focused on rare genetic \\ndiseases of the liver, muscle, and central nervous system.\\n\\nmRNA COVID–19 vaccines have sparked continued scientific innovation \\nin infectious diseases and rare genetic diseases.\\n\\nOf course, Pfizer’s work in COVID–19 continues. We are also \\nworking to address emerging variants of concern with the \\nintroduction of the BA.1 and BA.4/5 bivalent vaccines to many \\ncountries across the world. Along with our collaboration \\npartner BioNTech, we are advancing the next-generation of \\nvaccines for SARS-CoV-2 and investigating a novel combination \\nvaccine candidate against COVID–19 and influenza that could \\nprovide protection against these two infections with one \\nvaccine.\\n\\nWe are looking forward to more scientific advances with \\nPfizer’s mRNA efforts in 2023 and beyond. \\n\\n23\\n\\n2022 Stories\\n\\nPfizer 2022 Annual Review\\x0cA Year In Review\\n\\n2022 Stories\\n\\nESG\\n\\nPerformance\\n\\nAbout This Review\\n\\nAnti-infectives\\n\\nBreakthroughs in the Fight Against \\nAntimicrobial Resistance\\n\\nOur industry-leading initiatives to address this growing threat to  \\nglobal health. \\n\\nThe COVID–19 pandemic has been a stark reminder of \\nthe health and economic hardships caused by infectious \\ndiseases. It has also worsened drug-resistant infections and \\nreinforced the need to invest in responsible antimicrobial use, \\ndiagnostics, surveillance, and research and development to \\nhelp minimize the impact of future global health crises—like \\nantimicrobial resistance (AMR).1,2\\n\\nAMR is one of the biggest threats to global health today and \\ncan affect anyone, of any age, in any country. If it continues \\nto rise unchecked, minor infections could become life-\\nthreatening, serious infections could become impossible to \\ntreat, and many routine medical procedures could become too \\nrisky to perform.3,4 Without action by governments, industry, \\nand society, AMR is expected to cause 10 million deaths each \\nyear by 2050.4 \\n\\nAs a global anti-infective leader, we’re committed to tackling \\nAMR. Pfizer was proud to start the year ranked as a joint \\nindustry leader by the Access to Medicines Foundation AMR \\nBenchmark report, which highlighted our innovative policies \\nto improve access to our medicines and our leadership in \\nantimicrobial stewardship.5 \\n\\nGood antimicrobial stewardship—a systematic, rational \\napproach to the responsible use of antimicrobials—is \\nfoundational to help curb AMR. \\n\\nDiagnostics can play an important role in stewardship \\npractices and are an under-used resource. This year, Pfizer \\nannounced a collaboration with BD (Becton, Dickinson and \\nCompany) and Wellcome to better understand the role of \\ndiagnostics in advancing antimicrobial stewardship practices \\naround the world.6\\n\\nAntimicrobial surveillance—the monitoring of changes in \\npopulations of microbes to help understand patterns of \\nresistance to anti-infectives—is critical for effective infection \\nprevention. Access to such data allows key decision-makers \\nto better adapt antimicrobial stewardship programs to help \\ncombat the spread of resistant pathogens. \\n\\nLeadership and Surveillance (ATLAS) database.7 Vivli’s AMR \\nRegister will allow researchers, national governments, and \\nmulti-lateral organizations to access multiple industry datasets \\nin one place to aid in identifying the emergence of new \\nantimicrobial-resistant pathogens.  \\n\\nAntimicrobial surveillance—the monitoring of changes in populations of \\nmicrobes to help understand patterns of resistance to anti-infectives—is \\ncritical for effective infection prevention.\\n\\nA robust pipeline of new antimicrobials is essential to \\nrestoring the balance against increasing rates of AMR. \\nHowever, significant economic hurdles have made research \\nand development in this area a challenge. No novel class of \\nantibiotics has been launched for almost 40 years, and even \\nwhen newly approved treatments come to market, they may \\nbe used sparingly to support good antimicrobial stewardship \\npractices—making it difficult to recover the high cost \\nassociated with development. New reimbursement models \\nthat more fully reflect the complete value of antimicrobials are \\ncritical.\\n\\nWe continued our leadership in finding creative solutions to \\naddress AMR in 2022 in a world-first cross-industry innovative \\nreimbursement model for antimicrobials.  \\n\\nIn 2022 we led the way as a founding contributor to the \\nnon-profit Vivli’s AMR Register, sharing raw antimicrobial \\nsurveillance data from our pioneering Antimicrobial Testing \\n\\nIn June, Pfizer partnered with NHS England, NICE, and \\nthe UK Government on an innovative ‘subscription-type’ \\nmodel for antibiotics.8 The model aims to move away from \\n\\n24\\n\\n2022 Stories\\n\\nPfizer 2022 Annual Review\\x0cA Year In Review\\n\\n2022 Stories\\n\\nESG\\n\\nPerformance\\n\\nAbout This Review\\n\\nreimbursement based on number of prescriptions and \\ninstead focus on the value antibiotics bring to the public.

For \\nPfizer, delivering lifesaving treatments for all means ensuring \\nthat our clinical trials accurately represent the diverse \\ncommunities impacted by the diseases we seek to treat or \\nprevent. As part of these efforts, Breakthroughs for All™ is \\nPfizer’s commitment to diverse and inclusive participation in \\nclinical trials through equitable access and practices.  \\n\\nRace, ethnicity, age, biological sex, and cultural background all \\ninform how effective vaccines and medicines are for individual \\npeople. Pfizer has increased its efforts to design and conduct \\nclinical trials that more accurately reflect the racial and ethnic \\ndiversity of the locations where our trials are conducted and \\nthe epidemiology of the diseases we intend to treat or prevent. \\n\\nTo accomplish this goal, we must proactively, intentionally, \\nand regularly address the historic barriers that have partially \\nresulted in underrepresentation in clinical trials, including \\ncommunity mistrust and lack of clinical trial awareness. \\nBuilding trust and increasing awareness in diverse \\ncommunities requires strong relationships with influential \\nand embedded community organizations, including major \\nuniversities, research organizations, and trusted community \\nvoices in local pharmacies, hospitals, and religious institutions. \\n\\nOne example is our recent partnership with the Tigerlily \\nFoundation to launch Health Equity, Advocacy, and Leadership \\n(HEAL) sessions to advance education around clinical trials \\nfor Black women with breast cancer. This effort is critically \\nimportant as, in addition to historic underrepresentation in \\nbreast cancer clinical trials,1 Black women are often diagnosed \\nat a later stage and have a worse prognosis compared to white \\nwomen.2 During these sessions, we focus on shedding light \\non the breast cancer journey for women of color, improving \\naccess to breast cancer clinical trials, building trust and \\nenhancing relationships between cancer patients and their \\ncare providers, and identifying barriers and solutions to \\nimprove access to trials, with the intent that this knowledge \\nwill be shared across other treatment areas. \\n\\n“Every person deserves the right to a healthy life, and our \\neffort to improve diversity in clinical trials to increase the \\n\\noverall population’s benefit from clinical research is a matter \\nof equity. Our work alongside Tigerlily aims to empower Black \\nwomen with breast cancer, who are at a higher risk of disease \\nbut less likely to enroll in a clinical trial that may prove to be \\nlifesaving. Our goal—through this partnership and others \\nlike it—is to provide communities with the knowledge to \\nfeel more educated and supported to participate in clinical \\ntrials, furthering the real-life impact of important scientific \\ndiscovery,\" said Judy Sewards, Pfizer Vice President, Head of \\nClinical Trial Experience.   \\n\\nFor Pfizer, delivering lifesaving treatments for all means ensuring that \\nour clinical trials accurately represent the diverse communities impacted \\nby the diseases we seek to treat or prevent.\\n\\nAlthough there is still work to be done, we have made \\nimportant progress in raising awareness, building trust, \\nand increasing access to clinical trials for even more people. \\nBreakthroughs for All™ are made possible by those who \\nchoose to participate in clinical trials, and we’re committed \\nto working closely with all potential partners, including \\ncommunities, their leaders, and industry professionals, to not \\nonly ensure that all who are interested in joining a clinical trial \\nhave the right information and opportunity to do so, but also \\nthat the therapies we bring to market are truly beneficial to \\npatients and their families.  \\n\\n1   Bonner D, Cragun D, Reynolds M, Vadaparampil ST, Pal T.

The urgency of \\nCOVID–19 forced us all to think differently and challenge the \\ntypical discovery and development timeline while maintaining \\nour high standards for safety and quality, which led to the \\ndevelopment of an authorized vaccine in less than a year and a \\ntreatment in less than 18 months. \\n\\nLightspeed is how we instill a pioneering spirit across our \\nteams so that we can keep pushing innovative thinking further \\nand move at the speed of science.\\n\\nHowever, long before the pandemic—over the course of the \\nlast decade—Pfizer has been transforming our research and \\ndevelopment approach, revving up our engine of innovation \\nand making profound changes across multiple dimensions \\nto empower our scientists for critical decision-making. This \\nimportant evolution laid the foundation for responding with \\n“lightspeed” in the pandemic and continues to usher in a new \\nwave of breakthroughs at Pfizer. Specifically:\\n• \\n\\nSince 2019, we’ve decreased our median first-in-human \\nto approval development timeline for new medicines and \\nvaccines from nine years to approximately five years in \\n2022. We have ambitious goals to reduce timelines even \\nfurther so we can get medicines to patients even faster.\\nBy the end of 2022, Pfizer achieved an end-to-end success \\nrate of 18 percent—from first-in-human to approval at a \\nnew molecular entity level—which is nearly 10 times our \\n2010 performance. \\nBy the end of 2021, we demonstrated a durable \\nperformance on Phase 2 success rates for New Molecular \\nEntities of 60% versus an industry median of 37%.1\\n•  We’re proud of our achievement to date and intent to \\nmaintain our focus in industry leading success rates, \\nenabling us to continue to deliver breakthroughs to \\npatients.\\n\\n• \\n\\n• \\n\\n“There is no greater indicator of our commitment to delivering \\nbreakthroughs for patients than clinical success rates,” said \\nMikael Dolsten, MD, PhD, Chief Scientific Officer and President, \\nWorldwide Research, Development and Medical at Pfizer. \\n“And while there is much that goes into making a successful \\nmedicine or vaccine, taking bold steps to safely accelerate \\ndevelopment timelines of these innovations is the real \\ndifference-maker that our lightspeed mindset has had on our \\norganization.”\\n\\nLightspeed includes searching for opportunities that upend \\nthe standard approach to clinical development in areas with \\na high unmet need, where Pfizer can make a big impact \\nthrough our science, capabilities, and thoughtful risk-taking. \\n\\n• \\n\\n• \\n\\n• \\n\\n27\\n\\n2022 Stories\\n\\nPfizer’s ability to move at “lightspeed” is enabled by our deep R&D \\ntransformation over the past decade, which can be seen through the \\nCOVID–19 vaccine development.\\n\\nLeveraging lessons learned from the COVID–19 pandemic, \\nwe’ve solidified the lightspeed approach, which entails pulling \\nmultiple levers and deploying different strategies to move \\nfaster through the process for the benefit of all patients. \\nWhile not all levers can be pulled for every program, there \\nare certain elements that are at the core of the lightspeed \\nparadigm and are being applied to key programs across our \\npipeline:  \\n• \\n\\nParallel testing. This is the ability to design multiple \\nconstructs or formulations of a therapy or a vaccine and \\ntest them in parallel studies so that the candidate with the \\nbest safety, tolerability and/or efficacy can be identified. \\nParallel instead of sequential testing is perhaps one of the \\nmost defining traits of lightspeed.\\nExpert dose selection. It is important that our vaccines \\nand therapies are meticulously designed and tested so \\nthat we are enabled to optimize safety, tolerability, and \\nefficacy. \\nStreamlined governance for rapid decision-making. A \\nkey tenet is to ensure there is a simplified governance \\nmodel which allows decisions to be made nearly in real-\\ntime. \\nInvestment at risk.

We have witnessed \\nsignificant regulatory innovation by regulators during \\nthe pandemic, which has opened doors to greater digital \\ncollaboration and global harmonization of standards \\nto help drive innovation “at light speed.”  There is now \\nan opportunity for industry and regulators to emerge \\nstronger than before by applying the lessons that this \\ncrisis has taught us and by proactively considering which \\nof those learnings could be adopted permanently in \\nregulatory practice to help create a more efficient and \\npatient-centric “new normal.”\\n\\naccelerate the development of our Phase 3 vaccine candidate \\nfor respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), currently being evaluated \\nfor both adults aged 60 and older and pregnant people to \\nhelp protect their newborns.

At Pfizer, we know that global health challenges are \\ntoo great for any one company or organization to solve alone; \\nto tackle them, we must coordinate tools and minds around \\nthe world, including from outside our own walls. Too often, \\ninnovations with the potential to change lives face roadblocks \\nnot because they lack promise but because innovators may \\nnot have access to the resources that can help them live up \\nto their potential. Our decades-long expertise in investment \\nand acquisition has focused on breakthrough products \\nthat strategically grow our portfolios, giving us a unique \\nopportunity to identify promising medicines and help ensure \\nmore patients in need can access them as we grow.\\n\\nPartnerships will support ongoing exploration into innovative treatment \\noptions for patients \\n\\nIn recent years, Pfizer’s investments have supported \\ninnovation and product evolution, including preparation for \\npotential approvals and product launches, and support for \\nclinical trials. We are committed to strategically capitalizing on \\ngrowth opportunities, primarily by advancing our own product \\npipeline and maximizing the value of our existing products, \\nbut also through various business development activities. \\nWe view our business development activity as an enabler \\nof our strategies and seek to generate growth by pursuing \\nopportunities and transactions that have the potential to \\nstrengthen our business and our capabilities. We assess our \\nbusiness, assets and scientific capabilities/portfolio as part \\nof our regular, ongoing portfolio review process and also \\ncontinue to consider business development activities that will \\nhelp advance our business strategy. \\n\\nWe are committed to collaboration, with currently 40% of our \\nportfolio externally sourced or enabled through partnerships \\nat all stages of clinical and technological development and \\n\\nongoing business development. In October 2022, Pfizer \\nacquired both Biohaven Pharmaceutical Holding Company \\nLtd. (Biohaven), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical firm \\ninvestigating new therapies for neurological conditions, and \\nGlobal Blood Therapeutics (GBT), a company focused on the \\ndiscovery, development and delivery of treatments for people \\nliving with sickle cell disease (SCD).\\n\\nA key part of Pfizer’s acquisition of Biohaven was its innovative \\nmigraine therapy, rimegepant. Approved for both acute \\ntreatment and prevention of episodic migraine in adults, \\nrimegepant is part of a portfolio of promising calcitonin \\ngene-related peptide (CGRP) assets and an ongoing example \\nof Pfizer’s patient-focused investment. Pfizer’s acquisition of \\nBiohaven is part of our long-term work in pain and women’s \\nhealth, and continued momentum from a 2021 strategic \\ncollaboration for the commercialization of rimegepant outside \\nthe U.S. Through access to Primary Care Physicians, specialists \\nand health systems, Pfizer can support people living with \\nmigraine when they most need it. Our ongoing commitment \\nto rimegepant’s global success has helped bring an innovative \\nnew treatment option to the millions of patients around the \\nworld who live with migraine. \\n\\nPfizer’s acquisition of GBT brings a portfolio and pipeline \\nthat has the potential to address the full spectrum of critical \\nneeds for the underserved SCD community, reinforcing \\nPfizer’s commitment to SCD and building on a 30-year legacy \\nin the rare hematology space. With GBT’s talent, portfolio and \\npipeline now a part of the company, combined with the deep \\nmarket knowledge and insights Pfizer has built along with \\nits leading scientific and clinical capabilities, this acquisition \\nwill help accelerate innovation as we aim to bring potential \\nbreakthrough treatments to the SCD community as quickly  \\nas possible.\\n\\nBy providing access to global resources and scientific and \\nmarket expertise, Pfizer helps ensure continuity of promising \\nproducts and programs across industries, sectors and \\nstakeholders. Our sustained success in supporting products \\nthrough partnership and acquisition addresses some of the \\nmost diverse healthcare needs in the industry and cements \\nPfizer’s role as a leader in areas including oncology, neurology, \\nvaccines and antimicrobial resistance. With the expertise, \\ncapabilities and reach of an international biopharmaceutical \\ncompany and the entrepreneurial spirit of a nimble biotech, \\nwe are uniquely positioned to help accelerate the next era \\nof innovation through cutting-edge science and business \\nreimagination.\\n\\n29\\n\\n2022 Stories\\n\\nPfizer 2022 Annual Review\\x0cA Year In Review\\n\\n2022 Stories\\n\\nESG\\n\\nPerformance\\n\\nAbout This Review\\n\\nCommercial\\n\\nCounterfeit Prescription Drugs:  \\nHow Organizations are Combating the \\nSale of Fake Meds\\n\\nIn an expensive healthcare system, everybody wants more affordable \\nmedicine, but at what physical or emotional cost?\\n\\nIf you get caught in a medical fraudster\\'s trap, that cost may \\nbe steep. By taking counterfeit prescription drugs (which look \\nreal but aren\\'t), you not only run the risk of not receiving the \\nbenefits of the intended medication, but fakes can also harm \\nyou. Unsuspecting buyers may experience allergic reactions, \\noverdose, or other adverse effects caused by unapproved \\ningredients.1 Beyond the physical risks, they may also expose \\nthemselves to identity theft or financial fraud.\\n\\nSo how can you keep yourself and your family safe from fake \\nmeds? Start by learning as much as you can about counterfeit \\nmedicines: what they are, where they\\'re found, and what\\'s \\nbeing done to stop them.\\n\\nPfizer is committed to protecting the integrity of medications and \\nputting an end to counterfeits.\\n\\nOrganizations Tracking the Prevalence of Fake Meds\\n\\nWith counterfeit drugs, the packaging and design of the \\nmedicines may appear identical or nearly identical to a \\nlegitimate, approved drug that you were prescribed. However, \\nthe quality, storage, dosage, and/or ingredients may not \\nbe the same. Despite any claims you may see on the box, \\n\\ncounterfeits are not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug \\nAdministration (FDA).1 This is why organizations are so eager to \\nfind them and root them out.\\n\\nIn the United States, the FDA works with other agencies as well \\nas private companies to secure the supply chain of medical \\nproducts. For example, one partnership between the FDA \\nand the U.S. Customs and Border Protection helps to track \\nand intercept counterfeit drugs coming from overseas. The \\nFDA has also created industry standards as part of anti-\\ncounterfeiting initiatives, such as guidance about imprinting \\nidentifiers on pills, to help drug manufacturers differentiate \\nthe real stuff from the fakes.2\\n\\nWhile the World Health Organization (WHO) has reported that \\nit\\'s difficult to determine exactly how many fake drugs exist, \\nexperts do know they\\'re widespread: Counterfeits are found \\nworldwide, from the Americas and Africa to Europe and Asia.3\\n\\nOf all reported counterfeits worldwide, malaria and antibiotic \\nmedications are the most common at 19.6% and 16.9%, \\nrespectively.3 One public health expert experienced fake \\nantimalarials firsthand when he developed a dangerous form \\nof malaria after buying an illegitimate drug abroad that turned \\nout to contain just the common fever reducer we all know as \\nacetaminophen.4\\n\\nCombating Counterfeits Through Technology  \\nand Partnerships\\n\\nPfizer is committed to protecting the integrity of medications \\nand putting an end to counterfeits. As a participant in the \\nnonprofit campaign Fight the Fakes, Pfizer aims to help \\nraise awareness and share the experience of individuals and \\nfamilies affected by fake drugs. For people looking to help with \\non-the-ground change, Fight the Fakes has hosted an annual \\ncampaign.\\n\\nPfizer also combats the sale of counterfeit drugs by building \\nanti-counterfeiting laboratories. In these labs, teams \\ncontinually evaluate new technologies to analyze increasingly \\n\\n30\\n\\n2022 Stories\\n\\nPfizer 2022 Annual Review\\x0cA Year In Review\\n\\n2022 Stories\\n\\nESG\\n\\nPerformance\\n\\nAbout This Review\\n\\ncomplex counterfeits of Pfizer-produced drugs. Additionally, \\nPfizer\\'s Global Security team partners with the law \\nenforcement community to identify counterfeit medications \\nand respond to reports of counterfeits.\\n\\nThrough these partnerships and using advanced lab \\nequipment that helps determine drug authenticity, Pfizer \\nhas helped prevent over 302 million counterfeit doses from \\nreaching patients since 2004.\\n\\nWhat You Can Do to Stop Counterfeit Drugs\\n\\nVery often, medical fraudsters take advantage of people \\nlooking for a good discount on their medications. But there \\nare safer ways to receive medications more affordably, such as \\nasking for a discount card, requesting generics, or using mail-\\norder programs through your insurance.\\n\\nWhen looking for lower-priced medicines, be wary of any \\nonline drugstores that feature prices that seem too good to \\n\\nbe true or that don\\'t make a licensed pharmacist available to \\nanswer questions.1 Additionally, if buying online, look for a \\nNational Association of Boards of Pharmacy (NABP) Verified \\nInternet Pharmacy Practice Site (VIPPS) and always check \\nthe pharmacy\\'s license through their state agency: The FDA \\nprovides links to each state\\'s lookup tool.5\\n\\nIf you suspect you may have already taken a counterfeit \\nmedication, let your doctor know as soon as possible since \\ncounterfeits may lead to serious side effects, allergies, or \\nother health problems. You can also report the suspected \\ncounterfeit operation directly to the FDA.6\\n\\nNobody should have to suffer just because they sought a good \\ndeal.

Listen. Learn. That\\'s how we raise \\nawareness about the importance of vaccinations.\\n\\nAdvancing equitable health outcomes is one of the key pillars \\nof Pfizer’s Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) strategy. To \\nbring about real change in underserved communities, we must \\ngo where they are, listen to their needs, and connect with \\nthem in a relatable way. That’s why Pfizer went all in at the \\n2022 Essence Festival of Culture, the largest African American \\nculture and music event in the U.S. celebrating Black women. \\nAfter a two-year hiatus due to the pandemic, the festival \\nreturned with a vengeance this year. More than half a million \\npeople gathered in New Orleans, where multigenerational \\nBlack women shared and bonded over important topics,  \\nincluding personal development, wealth creation, civic \\nengagement, and community leadership. This year, Pfizer was \\na part of the conversation.\\n\\nPfizer brand ambassadors Deonna Smith, Sandy Jaquez, William Smith, \\nK. Micole Moffett at our Essence Fest booth.\\n\\nWith the pandemic still affecting every part of society, vaccine \\nhesitancy in the Black community remained a challenge. We \\nwanted to have conversations with the community where \\nthey felt safe and understood and address their concerns with \\ntransparency and respect.\\n\\nWe sponsored a panel discussion featuring global singer \\nand songwriter, Kelly Rowland from supergroup Destiny’s \\nChild, macro influencer and former pharmacist, Brittney \\nFusilier, and pediatrician, Dr. Kersha Pennicott. The panelists \\ndiscussed their personal experiences and the choices they \\nmade surrounding their family’s health amid COVID–19. We \\ncontinued the conversation with the festival participants \\nat our Pfizer booth located in the Essence Health Hub. We \\nintentionally chose not to have any Pfizer vaccine branding. \\nVisitors to the booth participated in an interactive quiz on \\nEssence Festival, Black History, and COVID–19 and received \\neducational resources on COVID–19 and the importance of \\nvaccinations including boosters.\\n\\nWe also partnered with micro influencers—Lauren Wilson, \\nMadelyn Brené, and Titilola-Sogunro—to help spark social \\nmedia conversations on COVID–19 vaccinations and encourage \\nattendees to visit the booth and meet Pfizer colleagues. \\nRamcess Jean-Louis, Pfizer’s Chief Diversity, Equity, and \\nInclusion Officer, members of the Global Black Community \\ncolleague resource group, and leaders from across Pfizer \\nwere there to share their own unique experiences with \\nfestivalgoers. \\n\\n“Women are often what we call the ‘Chief Health Officers’ \\nof their families,” said Zainab Wasti, Pfizer\\'s U.S. COVID–19 \\nVaccine Consumer Experience Lead. “Being at Essence was \\nsuch an important opportunity to meaningfully connect with \\nBlack women who are at the center of making healthcare \\ndecisions for themselves, their children, and their parents. We \\nlistened to their stories and we learned. And we will continue \\nto do so in order to better serve them.”\\n\\n“So many women watched our panel and came to our booth \\nsharing the impact that vaccinations have had on their lives,” \\nsaid Kathryn Simmons, Pfizer Area Business Manager, Internal \\nMedicine. “Being able to see one another in person, to look \\none another in the eye, helped us build trust. I’m overjoyed \\nthat we were able to make this moment happen for so many \\nBlack women who represent the communities we serve across \\nthe country.”\\n\\n“At Pfizer, we believe we should all feel seen, heard, and cared \\nfor. We should feel safe to connect with one another as human \\nbeings, with respect and honesty.

We were able to make so many connections \\nand show up authentically as a trusted partner and ally in  \\nthe community.”\\n\\nPfizer plans to continue its sponsorship of Essence Festival \\nagain in 2023 and will continue to engage the community \\nwhere they are.\\n\\n44\\n\\n2022 Stories\\n\\nPfizer 2022 Annual Review\\x0cA Year In Review\\n\\n2022 Stories\\n\\nESG\\n\\nPerformance\\n\\nAbout This Review\\n\\nDigital\\n\\nData and AI are Helping to Get \\nMedicines to Patients Faster\\n\\nDigital innovation helps deliver COVID–19 oral treatment, PAXLOVID® \\n(nirmatrelvir tablets and ritonavir tablets), to patients.\\n\\nData, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and supercomputing are \\naccelerating innovation across Pfizer—from discovery to \\nclinical development, manufacturing, distribution, and \\ncommercialization—to help bring medicines to patients in \\nneed faster than ever before. This was certainly the case with \\nPAXLOVID, Pfizer’s COVID–19 oral treatment.  \\n\\nIn research and discovery, supercomputing capabilities paired \\nwith advanced computational methods helped Pfizer scientists \\noptimize their search for the right molecules to be able to \\ndeliver PAXLOVID orally rather than intravenously. This was a \\ngame-changer because it meant that patients could take the \\ntreatment at home rather than in a hospital setting, which \\nhas significantly increased access to treatment for millions of \\npeople around the world.\\n\\nData, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and supercomputing are\\naccelerating innovation across Pfizer.\\n\\nAI and machine learning (ML) capabilities also played a key role \\nin running Pfizer’s PAXLOVID clinical trials, enabling the team \\nto perform quality-checks and analyze vast amounts of patient \\ndata 50% faster than before. Building on this success, AI and \\n\\nML capability are used in more than half of all Pfizer’s  \\nclinical trials.\\n\\nPfizer colleagues have also leveraged data and AI to optimize \\nthe manufacturing of PAXLOVID, by analyzing supply chain \\ndata to identify, address, and monitor issues in production, \\ncreating a system of continuous improvement. In one case, \\nthe cycle time of a critical step in the supply chain was able to \\nbe reduced by 67%, which enabled the production of 20,000 \\nextra doses per batch. With the predictive capabilities of AI, \\nPfizer can manufacture more medicines to benefit even more \\npatients around the world. \\n\\nThe last important step has been to ensure that patients in \\nneed receive treatment in a timely manner. One of the biggest \\nchallenges many countries face is underreporting of COVID–19 \\ninfection rates. In the U.S., for example, Pfizer applied \\nadvanced analytics to analyze wastewater data provided by \\nthe Center for Disease Control, validating that infection rates \\naround the country were much higher than had been reported \\nthrough standard testing. And going deeper, Pfizer scientists \\nhave analyzed diagnosis and treatment rates and data from \\nhealthcare professionals, to identify and understand where \\ndisparities in treatment exist. \\n\\nThese data-driven efforts to identify underserved communities \\nand barriers to treatment access have helped Pfizer engage \\nin informed discussions with governments as they work to \\nimprove patient access to diagnosis and treatment. In the \\nU.S., this has helped build the case for government initiatives \\nsuch as mobile testing sites and authorizing state-licensed \\npharmacists to prescribe treatments for eligible patients, with \\ncertain limitations. \\n\\nThanks to the power of data and AI, Pfizer is not only \\ndeveloping more breakthroughs like PAXLOVID, faster than \\never before but also increasing the potential for patients to \\naccess the breakthroughs they need.\\n\\nPAXLOVID has not been approved, but has been authorized for emergency use by FDA under an EUA, for the treatment of adults and pediatric \\npatients (12 years of age and older weighing at least 40 kg) with a current diagnosis of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 and who are at high risk for \\nprogression to severe COVID-19, including hospitalization or death.\\n\\nThe emergency use of PAXLOVID is only authorized for the duration of the declaration that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of the \\nemergency use of drugs and biological products during the COVID-19 pandemic under Section 564(b)(1) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360bbb-3(b)(1), unless \\nthe declaration is terminated or authorization revoked sooner.\\n\\n45\\n\\n2022 Stories\\n\\nPfizer 2022 Annual Review\\x0cA Year In Review\\n\\n2022 Stories\\n\\nESG\\n\\nPerformance\\n\\nAbout This Review\\n\\nDigital\\n\\nHarnessing Digital Health Solutions to \\nImprove Patients’ Lives\\n\\nEmbracing AI-based technology to provide treatment support for \\npatients with breast cancer.\\n\\nDigital technology is rapidly changing the world of healthcare, \\nand at Pfizer, we are harnessing this technology to live our \\npurpose: breakthroughs that change patients’ lives. This \\nincludes providing digital health solutions that support \\npatients when they need help the most—during their \\ntreatment journeys.\\n\\nIn 2022, we partnered with Walgreens to launch the Amba™ \\nDigital Wellness Coach, an artificial intelligence (AI)-based \\nmobile app that aims to support patients who have been \\nprescribed IBRANCE® (palbociclib) for the treatment of \\nmetastatic breast cancer. When patients receive their first \\nprescription from a Walgreens community-based specialty \\npharmacy, they can enroll in the app, which provides relevant \\neducation, tips, self-scheduled medication reminders, a \\nconnection with their social support network, and other useful \\nresources as they begin their treatment. Amba can also alert \\nthe pharmacy that a patient may need outreach from the \\npharmacist.\\n\\nDigital companions such as Amba are designed to help \\npatients understand their medication and provide information \\nin patient-friendly language to help minimize confusion and \\nidentify supportive resources. Over time, we anticipate that \\nthe AI capabilities developed by Catalia Health, which are a \\ncore part of the Amba app, will provide a more personalized \\npatient experience, and we also are monitoring the program \\nto see if it could apply to other therapeutic areas. We see this \\nas a major step forward in the effort to use the power of digital \\ntechnology to support patients. \\n\\nAt the heart of this effort is Pfizer’s abiding commitment to \\nputting patients first. We know that there is so much more we \\ncan do to support patients in their treatment journeys, and \\nwe are proud to help lead the way for them, into the future of \\ndigital health. \\n\\nDigital companions such as Amba™ help patients understand their \\nmedication and provide information in patient-friendly language to help \\nminimize confusion and identify supportive resources.\\n\\n46\\n\\n2022 Stories\\n\\nPfizer 2022 Annual Review\\x0cA Year In Review\\n\\n2022 Stories\\n\\nESG\\n\\nPerformance\\n\\nAbout This Review\\n\\nLiving Our Values \\n\\nOur Environmental, Social, and Governance \\nperformance helps us to deliver on our purpose \\nevery day.  \\n\\nLearn more about our progress on our goals in \\nour ESG report.\\n\\n47\\n\\nLiving Our Values\\n\\nPfizer 2022 Annual Review\\x0cA Year In Review\\n\\n2022 Stories\\n\\nESG\\n\\nPerformance\\n\\nAbout This Review\\n\\nA Closer Look at ESG\\n\\nEnvironment\\n\\nThe health of our global environment impacts everyone.

In fact, returns from \\npharmaceutical companies lagged the S&P 500 by about one-third, and biotech fared \\neven worse. \\n\\nLooking at the stock performance of the top 50 pharmaceutical companies, the divide \\nbetween the leaders and laggards has been widening. In 2021, the five-year total \\nshareholder return (TSR) for drugmakers in the top quintile was up by 29%, \\ncompared with a decline of 11% in the bottom quintile, according to a PwC analysis \\n(figure 2). As performance pressures mount, investors are taking a closer look at \\nwhich pharma companies are positioned to win and allocating their investments \\naccordingly. \\n\\n \\n\\x0cOvercoming the performance challenge \\n\\nMarket headwinds are well documented. Drugmakers are grappling with extended \\ndrug development timelines, pricing scrutiny, high costs of regulation and litigation, \\nand increasing competition in nearly every category. Another wave of patent \\nexpirations is just around the corner, meaning more therapeutic areas will have \\ngeneric or biosimilar alternatives. Gross margins for some novel treatments, such as \\nchimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy, are well below historical averages \\nand the increasing personalization of medicine means manufacturers need to \\ngenerate returns on smaller populations of patients. All of these forces need to be \\novercome in pursuit of higher shareholder returns. \\n\\nFirst, as leaders set the path ahead, they should incorporate a sharper lens on \\nshareholder value creation into everyday decision-making. Connecting product-\\nmarket decisions (e.g., portfolio choices, launch investments, production expansions) \\nto shareholder value creation across the enterprise is essential to help translate great \\nscience into great returns.  \\n\\n \\n\\x0cSimilarly, another overarching imperative will be delivering on the promise of digital \\ninnovation. PwC research shows results to date have been disappointing. Looking \\nahead, the pharmaceutical industry can learn a lot from leading tech companies in \\nareas like developing digital products, personalizing customer engagement, \\nharnessing new types of data, deploying intelligent automation and working in a more \\nagile fashion. \\nWith a foundation set on those goals, pharma leaders can gain competitive \\nadvantage by focusing on five key actions: \\n\\nBuild differentiated capabilities to outperform competition: \\n\\nKey industry capabilities (e.g., decentralized trials, machine learning at scale) will \\nhelp drive the business forward in a differentiated manner. Companies that execute \\nflawlessly on these capabilities will have a competitive advantage. \\n\\nRetain talent, prioritize culture: \\n\\n In the age of “The Great Resignation” and the ”war for talent,” having a differentiated \\nculture to attract and retain the right staff will be critical. Employees want to find \\npurpose and know that what they are doing can drive change in the world. For \\nemployees at pharmaceutical companies, work means saving lives. Doubling down \\non this mission, while building a unique culture that matches your strategic \\nimperatives is critical. Communicating and executing on those values daily will help \\ndrive the most sustained loyalty from your personnel. \\n\\nProtect the enterprise: \\n\\nGiven the aforementioned challenges in the industry, it will be critical to minimize any \\ndownside risk around cybersecurity, regulatory challenges and legal matters in order \\nto preserve value. \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cDrive more returns from large IT and cloud investments: \\n\\nCompanies have made massive investments in enterprise resource planning (ERP) \\nsystems, artificial intelligence (AI), automation and cloud. Now is the time to \\ncapitalize on these investments, driving them to the front-end patient experience to \\nimprove customer satisfaction, while also improving the efficiency of operations. \\n\\nThink broadly about portfolio and transactions: \\n\\nThe industry spends a lot of effort and focus on determining where best to drive the \\nbusiness strategically (e.g., geography, therapeutic categories, scientific modalities). \\nThere is no doubt that making the right strategic choices can provide a lot of \\nheadroom, however, we see returns accelerated by better execution of divestitures \\nas well as in building out the best-in-class partnership ecosystem to drive leading \\nscience, technologies and talent to the business. \\n\\nDownloadNext in pharma report  \\n\\nBuild differentiated capabilities to outperform competition \\n\\nAssets, such as patents and products, have always been important to value growth in \\nthe pharmaceuticals sector. But assets come and go. Capabilities are enduring and \\ncan create a lasting competitive advantage. As pharmaceutical companies look to \\noutperform in the future marketplace, six capabilities are expected to be critical to \\nsuccess: \\n\\n1.  Putting the patient at the center with decentralized trials \\n2.  Adopting human-machine technologies at scale \\n3.  Capitalizing on digital innovation in the value proposition \\n4.  Taking real-world evidence to the next level \\n\\n \\n \\n  \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0c5.  Reimagining customer engagement with analytics and technology \\n6.  Taking a new approach to budgeting with value-based planning \\n\\nPutting the patient at the center with decentralized trials \\n\\nPatient-centric trial design is a hot topic today and is expected to be a defining \\ncapability for the future. The COVID-19 pandemic drove the industry to rethink the \\ntraditional paradigm for clinical trials, accelerating the development and use of \\ndecentralized design. The ability to design, execute and oversee clinical trials that run \\nin the home, near the home in retail pharmacies and health clinics and virtually is \\na must-have. Decentralized settings reduce the burdens on participants, such as the \\nneed to travel to a major academic medical center, and therefore increase the \\nnumber of individuals willing to participate in a study. More convenient and less \\nburdensome trials also increase the odds of retaining participants throughout a study. \\nFurthermore, decentralized trials hold great promise for reaching underrepresented \\ncommunities, resulting in more relevant research in which the study population looks \\nlike the disease population in the real world. \\nWhile the potential impact for patients (less burden, more access to trials) and for \\nsponsors (faster trial enrollments, reduced dropout rates, more competitive trial \\ndesign) is significant, creating a winning capability in decentralized trials means \\nadopting significant changes. R&D leaders should evaluate their portfolios to assess \\nwhich trials are best suited for a decentralized design, change processes related to \\ntrial enablement, update the vendor ecosystem to include suppliers that specialize in \\ndecentralized trials and upgrade the use of data and analytics to support the trial life \\ncycle. All of this will need to occur while balancing the ability to execute and oversee \\ntraditional randomized clinical trial activities. Those who get it right will be living the \\nindustry’s “patient at the center” mantra, while increasing their own odds of success \\nin the competition to recruit and retain patients. \\nDrive more returns from large IT and cloud investments \\n\\nThe six essential capabilities can only be delivered at scale with the power of the \\ncloud. Companies should create the data, analytics and technology environments to \\npower the modern pharma and life sciences enterprise and support new capabilities, \\nsuch as leveraging cloud native services to extract key information from documents \\nand cost-effectively managing large volumes of near-real-time data. \\nCloud platforms are typically leveraged by pharmaceutical companies for either \\ninfrastructure (migration to cloud for compute power and storage) or for their \\ninnovative tools (services) such as natural language processing, speech-to-text \\nconversion and machine learning. \\n\\nPharma companies are currently in various stages of migration to the cloud \\ninfrastructure, a transition that promises improved efficiencies, expanded service \\nofferings and lower costs for operations. Moving legacy applications to the cloud \\ncould cut the cost, but in order to realize these savings, companies must make \\nsubstantial investments in modernizing their IT infrastructure to take advantage \\nof cloud-native architectures for their aging legacy systems. \\n\\nA more rapid path to cloud benefits is acceleration of innovation through cloud-native \\nservices. For example, voice-to-text conversion services along with natural language \\n\\n\\x0cprocessing services can detect safety events and product issues through call center \\noperations, improving quality and reducing review effort and time. Machine learning \\ncan be used to automate product complaints and adverse events processing, \\nreducing effort and duration. These examples are real and just a taste of the benefits \\nto be had leveraging cloud-native services. \\n\\nIn a 2021 PwC survey of health industry leaders, 42% of respondents said that \\nimproving the experience for patients was the main goal behind investing in cloud \\ntechnology. Among other patient-friendly offerings, cloud computing supports the \\nplanning of decentralized trials, identifying aspects of trial design that will or will \\nnot work at remote sites, helping to minimize burdens and boosting the likelihood of \\nsuccess.  \\n\\nIn the next five years we expect all of the top 20 pharma companies will adopt a \\ncomprehensive cloud strategy—encompassing migration to cloud infrastructure and \\ncloud-native services to drive innovation. \\n\\nRetain talent, prioritize culture \\n\\nOver the past decade, PwC’s annual global culture survey has consistently shown \\nthat organizations with a distinct culture deliver higher growth and profitability than \\ntheir industry peers. Culture can either accelerate or hinder the types of \\ntransformational changes that will define the drugmaker of the future. So there’s no \\ngetting around the role of culture in driving an uplift to pharmaceutical sector \\nperformance.  \\nWhile every company will make its own choices on the behaviors to emphasize in \\ntheir unique culture, two themes will be important in the cultural underpinnings \\nof tomorrow’s pharma company: \\n\\n \\n\\x0c“Next-generation transformation at scale means every part of the enterprise \\nwill need to innovate.” \\n\\nTrust comes first, owning ESG \\n\\nThe first is trust. Trust is a precious commodity, especially for a sector that asks \\nindividuals to participate in scientific experiments, share personal data and pay \\nsignificant amounts of money for the promise of improved health. Organizational \\nbehaviors aligned to building trust with external stakeholders such as customers, \\npartners and regulators are critical to living the industry’s purpose, and also to \\nrealizing the value that can be created in areas such as digital engagement, real-\\nworld evidence and decentralized trials. In particular, behaviors to build trust in \\nunderserved and underrepresented populations will be increasingly important to both \\nimproving societal outcomes and accessing new patients.  \\n\\nEnsuring a culture of trust internally is similarly important. About half of the \\nemployees who participated in PwC’s 2021 Global Culture Survey reported not \\nfeeling listened to, seen or included at work. CEOs’ responses to the same survey \\nrevealed a much rosier outlook (figure 4). This disconnect tells us that managers \\nmight pay lip service to inclusion, but that employees aren’t feeling real effects from \\nall the talk. \\n\\n \\n\\x0cIn an industry that relies on highly skilled knowledge workers, trust is essential for \\nattracting and retaining talent, as well as bringing employees along in the \\ntransformation journey. Employees should believe that: \\n\\n•  The company is “doing the right thing”, living its purpose and owning \\n\\nits environmental, social and governance (ESG) responsibilities to society. \\n\\n•  They can be their authentic selves at work. \\n\\n•  They have the autonomy to integrate work and life, including more \\n\\nempowerment and flexibility in how they carry out their responsibilities. \\n\\nThe leaders of the future should nurture a deep sense of belonging and create a \\nbond of trust with their people. Being bold and bringing back the feeling of pride to \\nthe industry will be critical to not only maintaining current employees, but becoming \\nthe employer of choice. \\n\\nTake risks to innovate \\n\\nThe second key cultural theme is innovation. Of course pharma is innovative, right? \\nConcerns about taking risks and going outside of traditional comfort zones can put a \\ndamper on new ideas, especially in large-scale, established companies. Next-\\ngeneration transformation at scale means every part of the enterprise will need to \\ninnovate. \\n\\nEmphasizing behaviors related to reimagination, creative destruction, lifelong \\nlearning and new types of multidisciplinary teaming will help to counteract institutional \\nforces that can squash innovation. No corporate center is powerful enough or all-\\nknowing enough to drive change exclusively from the top. Along with significant \\nbusiness-led investments, innovation will come from digitally upskilled employees \\nwho are close to the work, committed to the mission and feel empowered to pursue \\nnew ideas.This type of citizen-led innovation has the potential to become a self-\\nreinforcing system of innovation and value creation. Encouraging these behaviors is \\na must for drugmakers who expect to be on the cutting edge of both science and \\nbusiness. \\n\\nA culture deeply rooted in trust and innovation will be an accelerator in the journey \\nahead. The leader’s work is to ensure these themes are infused into everyday \\norganizational behaviors in a way that creates a lasting advantage for the company. \\n\\n \\n\\x0cThink broadly about portfolio and transactions \\n\\nTransactions have always been the fabric of the pharma industry, and deal activity \\nwill accelerate as companies look to inorganic activities to achieve their growth plans. \\nTransactions for products as well as capabilities are on the agenda for all CEOs. With \\nthe continued scrutiny of the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) on larger deals in \\npharma, most companies will need to drive a higher number of transactions to get the \\nsame outcomes. \\n\\nWhile every company has structures and funding to maximize a variety of transaction \\ntypes—from early stage investments to large-scale deals—given the competitive \\nlandscape, companies are going to need to revamp their business development \\nprocess to drive more outcomes from their transactions. \\n\\nSo where are there opportunities for enhancement? \\n\\n• \\n\\n• \\n\\n• \\n\\n• \\n\\nRevisit and rethink\\n\\nDefine a clear objective  \\n\\nReimagine the structure  \\n\\nCommit to a long-term plan  \\n\\nRevisit and rethink your overall buy/build/partner strategy and decision trees. \\n\\n \\n \\n\\x0cIn this dynamic and unstable business climate, having a clear yet agile approach to \\nevaluating all of your options will be key. Companies should continue to push harder \\non asking themselves whether products and services need to be made in-house. \\nFocusing on differentiated capabilities that will really be the critical value drivers \\nfor the business can provide the strategic path towards helping to clarify what is often \\nmuddied. \\n\\nProtect the enterprise \\n\\nWhile creating capabilities to enhance competitive advantage and value for your \\nbusiness is critical, you must also ensure the business is protected from factors that \\ncan destroy value, such as cyberattacks, quality and compliance problems, legal \\nmatters and other ethical challenges. Driving technology-enabled digital change can \\nbe the most efficient path forward. Companies that have appropriately focused on the \\npeople and process side of the equation and are now addressing technology will be \\nbetter equipped to manage threats. \\n\\nCybercrime continues to be a major focus of pharmaceutical company boards and \\nexecutives as cyberattacks increase in sophistication. PwC’s 2022 Global Economic \\nCrime and Fraud Survey (GECS) found that, among the 19 types of economic \\ncrime, cybercrime stood out as the most widespread—and most disruptive—event \\nexperienced over the past two years globally and domestically. Hackers are \\nbecoming increasingly sophisticated and are targeting large pharmaceutical \\ncompanies, putting clinical discovery trial data, patient health information and other \\npharmaceutical trade secrets in jeopardy. For example, a 2020 cyberattack on \\nthe European Medicines Agency exposed data for a leading coronavirus vaccine. \\n\\n \\n\\x0cWe assess that the overall cyber risk to the pharmaceutical industry remains high \\ndue to the continued threat of ransomware. There has been a significant increase in \\nransomware attacks along with the solidification of ransomware-as-a-service groups \\nas a preeminent threat. There is also a concurrent escalation of geopolitical \\ntensions with a nation-state actor currently at odds with the US, which could \\nsignificantly disrupt supply chain operations. Overall, nation-state actors continue to \\nbe a formidable threat, with many demonstrating interest in pharmaceutical \\ndevelopment. \\nGiven the broader labor changes, supply shortages and constantly changing supply \\nchain strategies and operations, the focus on quality can be challenging to \\nsustain, and the downside can have massive impacts on the business, including the \\npotential inability to manufacture products. \\n\\nHaving high standards of ethics is not enough anymore. Given the challenging labor \\nmarket and the need to drive better ESG results, ensuring that a company's core \\nvalues and purpose are front and center and that employees feel the meaning and \\npurpose of their work will be critical. Being bold and bringing back a feeling of pride to \\nthe industry will be critical not only to retaining current employees, but to becoming \\nthe employer of choice. \\n\\nThe winners in the industry will be able to optimize the human-technology interface \\nby leveraging data across the enterprise to derive insights. For example, by using \\nanalytics to automate the batch release process, not just to mitigate risks, but to \\nimprove the manufacturing process and yields. Some companies are leveraging \\nquality to improve clinical outcomes and accelerate the completion of clinical trials. \\n\\n“Having high standards of ethics is not enough anymore.” \\n\\n \\n\\x0cTax strategy paves way for long-term success \\n\\nGiven the global nature of the industry and the impact of tax on many aspects of the \\nbusiness, we see taxes continuing to be an area of value retention and creation. With \\npotentially changing supply chains from geopolitical instability, tax structuring and \\nplanning will be critical to prevent leakage. \\n\\nAlthough pharmaceutical companies got a reprieve in the US this March \\nwith changes to the corporate tax regime, global tax reform is still on the near \\nhorizon. Countries want their fair share of tax contributions from pharma companies \\nand are applying pressure for more transparency and increasing the number of audits \\nfrom government agencies. A two-pillar tax plan at the Organisation for Economic \\nCo-operation and Development (OECD) is complete and is set to take effect in 2023. \\nMaintaining a clear and defendable tax strategy that is agile given the environment \\nwill be key to long-term success. The winners will have tech-enabled, real-time \\nscenario planning on tax built into broader investment decisions to ensure \\noperational decisions have tax efficiencies embedded in the outcomes. \\n\\nThe path forward \\n\\nThe pharmaceutical industry mission is more important than ever—vaccines are \\nhelping the world climb out of the COVID-19 pandemic, innovative medicines are \\nhealing our loved ones and clinical trials are providing hope for so many. \\nIt is a privilege to serve this mission. Demands to do it well are rising, with discerning \\ninvestors looking to back the winners. In this environment, executives should be \\nasking themselves: \\n\\n \\n\\x0c•  Do we have a vision and roadmap for change? \\n\\n•  Are we developing capabilities for the future that are truly differentiated?  \\n\\n•  Are we making fast enough progress at scale? \\n\\n•  How strong are our enterprise protections? \\n\\n•  Are we positioned to get the most out of M&A activities and new ecosystem \\n\\npartnerships? \\n\\nIf you answered no to any of these questions, the time to act is now. Executive teams \\nshould ensure they have a game plan for transformation while also protecting the \\nenterprise, in order to create the value patients and shareholders expect. \\n\\n \\n\\x0c\", metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\mmozafar\\\\OneDrive - Capgemini\\\\Projects\\\\GenAI_Hackathon\\\\pdf-convertor\\\\input\\\\pwc_next_in_pharmaceuticals.pdf'}), Document(page_content='Next in pharma: Thriving in 2023 \\n\\nTop C-suite agenda topics that will help shape the year \\nEvery new year brings exciting possibilities, and we expect 2023 to offer another \\nwave of promising innovations in medicine. What will be different is the market \\nenvironment in which these innovations are discovered, developed and \\ncommercialized. \\n\\nIn 2023, delivering for patients and investors will happen against a backdrop of high \\ninflation, talent shortages, rising capital costs, challenging foreign exchange impacts, \\npressures on consumer spending and ongoing Federal Trade Commission (FTC) \\nscrutiny of transactions. These headwinds come on top of blockbuster patent \\nexpiries, rising competition across most therapeutic areas and the impact of the \\nInflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022. In a recent PwC survey, 90% of executives \\nsaid they were worried about the macroeconomic environment, with many already \\ntaking action to adjust strategic plans. \\nLeading pharmaceutical and life sciences companies can seize this moment to \\ntransform their businesses in bold ways. Across the sector, companies will need to \\noperate with lower costs and shorter timelines while maintaining quality and \\nencouraging innovation. That means reimagining work, tech-enabling the \\norganization and advancing the portfolio to achieve multiple objectives \\nsimultaneously. Investors demand both growth and profitability at the same time. \\nGiven the increasing separation between leading and laggard performers in \\npharma, as well as growing activism in capital markets, the reward for getting it right \\nand the penalty for missing the mark demand an agenda that delivers sustainable \\nbusiness outcomes that are quickly reflected in profit and loss (P&L) statements. \\n\\nFocusing on four areas will help enable success in 2023: \\n\\n•  Getting fit for growth quickly \\n•  Digitizing the value chain \\n•  Adapting to continued pressure on drug pricing \\n•  Winning in M&A in 2023 \\n\\nGetting fit for growth quickly \\nBudgets are coming under more scrutiny and the bar for spending is higher. In the \\nboardroom, capital allocation should be examined across business units through the \\nlens of higher returns. Businesses should demonstrate tangible advantages from \\nbeing under the same corporate roof, such that the portfolio is more valuable than the \\nsum of its parts. Across organizations, business units will need deeper insight on the \\nproductivity of talent and financial resources measured by function, geography and \\nproduct (Figure 1). Value-based planning — that is, a systematic approach for \\nallocating resources to help increase value — is a must-have in 2023. \\n\\n \\n\\x0cEven sophisticated pharmaceutical and life sciences companies that have undergone \\ncost reductions might consider ways to reallocate spending using a stronger value-\\nbased approach. Analytics can make underlying drivers of work more transparent \\nalongside more granular insights on productivity gains and reveal possibilities for \\nmaterial savings by applying cost discipline (Figure 2). \\n\\nRedesigned operating models, new choices on service delivery \\n\\nSimilarly, fundamental operating model choices should be back on the table for \\npharma and life sciences executives. Even companies with a historical commitment \\nto decentralized structures are taking a fresh look at globalizing capabilities and \\ncentralizing operations to scale efficiencies. The traditional boundaries of global \\nbusiness service organizations will likely be pushed into new areas, with a renewed \\nfocus on outsourcing, as the pandemic proved that even consultative service roles do \\nnot need to be co-located. \\n\\nCompanies will likely be asked to justify non-core services that are performed in-\\nhouse, especially as third-party markets can provide tech-enabled, market-based \\nsolutions for resource-intensive processes. We see this in our own business as \\nPwC’s solutions for healthcare provider contracting and payment, Sunshine Act \\nreporting and tax services are among the high-growth services propelling our \\nmanaged services with clients. Even the standard practices of organizing general and \\nadministrative (G&A) into traditional functions such as HR, legal and finance, will be \\nquestioned as companies rethink what’s needed to run their business. We imagine a \\nrole for a global enabling operations officer (EO2), responsible for overseeing a \\nportfolio of tech-enabled managed services, backed by strategic business partners \\nand a network of cost-effective internal service centers providing back-office support. \\nNo operating model review will be complete without rethinking governance. Like other \\nfeatures of the operating model, decision-making constructs need to deliver multiple \\nobjectives simultaneously, namely speed and quality, without adding risk. This means \\nstrong leadership alignment on strategic priorities; leading data and analytics \\ncapabilities to support real-time decision-making; increased use of simplification \\ntechniques such as archetypes and investment principles; and empowerment of \\nfrontline leaders to make decisions, move quickly and be accountable. \\n\\nGrowth remains the lifeblood of the industry as it means more patients gain access to \\nmore medicines. PwC’s fit for growth transformation approach can help companies \\ndeliver both growth and returns, separating themselves from the rest of the pack. \\nEmbedding better analytics in the business enables better judgment. It’s a key \\ncomponent of value-based planning — making it possible to create up to 20% more \\nflexibility in the budget even after previous cost transformation exercises. \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\x0cLearn more \\n\\n•  Case study: PTC Therapeutics automates compliance \\n•  Learn more about the Fit for Growth approach \\n•  Podcast on value-based spending and resource allocation \\n\\nDigitizing the value chain \\nThis is the year to monetize investments in digital technology. Advanced analytics, \\nautomation and artificial intelligence have proven use cases across the value chain \\nfor driving transformation (Figure 2). Many of these technologies are in early \\ndevelopment and are already delivering a big impact. As one example in drug \\ndevelopment, a neuroscience business saved nearly 40% on a pivotal Phase III \\nstudy and reduced the timeline by 25% by harnessing the power of intelligent clinical \\ntrial design. Multiplied across a portfolio of Phase III assets, this equates to \\napproximately hundreds of millions of dollars in potential savings and countless \\nbenefits for patients awaiting new treatment options. \\n\\nDigital pharmaceutical and life science companies of the future can invest now to \\ncreate standout capabilities: \\n\\n•  Artificial intelligence-enabled discovery in research \\n\\n•  Smart factory technologies in production facilities \\n\\n•  Omnichannel orchestration in the commercial organization \\n\\n•  Control tower technologies connecting the supply chain \\n\\n• \\n\\nInsights on demand in finance \\n\\n \\n\\x0c•  Next generation automation in many enabling functions (for example, HR, tax, \\n\\ncompliance) \\n\\nWhile virtually every company has a digital program, industry executives need to \\ndetermine if they are delivering at the pace and value needed to truly transform how \\nthe company operates. They should ask themselves: \\n\\n•  How many hours of work should be eliminated over the next two years? \\n\\n•  How much faster will outcomes be achieved in a digitally-enabled environment? \\n\\n•  How much improvement in quality will potentially be realized? \\n\\nWe are seeing an uptick in the number of companies thinking differently about the \\nvalue metrics tied to their digital agenda and how to achieve scale. PwC’s digital \\ntransformation services help companies achieve these metrics through quarterly \\n“value drops” — releases of digital products that can change how work is done and \\ndeliver sustained outcomes for the business. \\n\\nNo digital transformation program can deliver its full potential without attention to the \\ncore enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems. In today’s fast-paced, competitive \\nenvironment, business and digital transformation are inextricably linked to ERP \\ncapabilities. It’s not about simply installing the next upgrade. Like other investments \\nin 2023, deployments of enterprise software solutions should be subject to a higher \\nbar for value creation. Business cases should go beyond IT-first savings like \\napplication rationalization. Instead, these investments need to reshape the \\neconomics of the business (for example, how inventory is managed and how \\ncustomers are served) and reset the foundation for what’s possible on top of an \\nenhanced and secure data environment. \\n\\nDigital as a team sport \\n\\nIn 2023, chief information officers (CIOs) and chief data officers (CDOs) will continue \\nto have an essential role in driving the digitization of the value chain in ways that are \\ninnovative, cost-effective and secure. They should lead the vision for what’s possible, \\nact as catalysts for change and serve as architects for the next generation of \\ncollaborative relationships necessary to deliver digital value at scale. \\n\\nThe role of business leaders throughout the company is just as important. In 2023, \\ntech is business. General managers need their own ideas for how to disrupt their \\nbusinesses with digital technology, leading with conviction and the willingness to take \\naction. Chief financial officers (CFOs) should insist that the company scorecard \\nshows how the organization is becoming more digital in all areas, and how those \\nadvances impact the P&L. HR leaders need ambitious plans for digital upskilling \\n\\n\\x0cacross the workforce to enable both digital invention and digital adoption can be \\nemployee-led as well as business-led. \\n\\nDigital transformation is a multidisciplinary undertaking that impacts every part of the \\ncompany. In 2023, all members of the leadership team — whether “digital” is in their \\njob title or not — play a major role in delivering value from digital technology across \\nthe enterprise. \\n\\n\\x0cLearn more \\n•  How and why Astellas built a cloud-based R&D platform \\n•  Patient-centric trial design a necessity for the future \\n\\n \\n\\x0c•  CFOs aim to accelerate digital transformation \\n\\nAdapting to continued pressure on drug pricing \\nThe Inflation Reduction Act put drug pricing front and center again. Among other \\nrequirements, the IRA establishes a price negotiation process for buying certain \\ndrugs for Medicare beneficiaries, and redesigns Medicare Part D to provide less-\\nexpensive coverage to beneficiaries. \\n\\nPharma and life sciences companies have completed their initial impact models, \\nupdated long-range plans and reset goals for volume growth and cost savings to \\nmitigate the impacts on pricing. \\n\\nNow, as 2023 unfolds and the realities of the IRA are absorbed, companies will \\nconsider which strategic levers should be pulled to drive value. IRA considerations \\nwill be built into the 2023 planning cycle, including processes related to portfolio \\nmanagement and product strategy. Management teams will likely have to tackle new \\nquestions, such as: \\n\\n•  How should we reorient disease area investments and future M&A decisions to \\naccount for increased risk in therapeutic areas more heavily concentrated in the \\nMedicare population? \\n\\n•  How does the time-to-negotiation difference (+13 years for biologics, +9 years \\n\\nfor small molecules) change pipeline and route of administration decisions given \\nthe advantage afforded to biologics and revenue pressure small molecules will \\nnow face earlier (compared to the 14-year historical average time to generic \\ncompetition)?1 \\n\\n•  How will the IRA affect research and development (R&D) planning, indication \\nexpansion, and launch sequencing, especially life cycle strategies for cancer \\ndrugs? \\n\\n•  How will the Medicare Part D benefits redesign coming in 2025 affect how plans \\ncover (or not cover) key drugs/classes, providing either a headwind or tailwind to \\nportfolios and pipelines? \\n\\n•  How should late life cycle management strategies be updated, including \\n\\nprioritization of successor drugs and settling of patent threats? \\n\\nWhile the IRA passed with an agenda focused on pricing and market access, the \\nramifications will likely ripple across the enterprise from commercial strategy through \\nR&D decision-making. With new pricing pressures starting in 2023 through Medicare \\ninflationary rebates, Part D plan redesign coming in 2025 and price negotiation \\nstarting in 2026, the way manufacturers begin to adjust in 2023 will potentially \\nprovide a critical foundation for the rest of the decade. \\n\\n\\x0cEven as the IRA creates a new set of pricing dynamics to consider, the old dynamics \\nare not going away — traditional pressures may become more acute in a \\nrecessionary environment as patients become more sensitive to out-of-pocket costs \\nand governments struggle with affordability. Capabilities in evidence generation, \\ngross-to-net management and payer insight generation should keep advancing even \\nas access and pricing teams prepare for the IRA as well as other pricing reforms that \\nmay emerge globally. \\n\\nLearn more \\n\\n•  What the Inflation Reduction Act means for pharma \\n\\nWinning in M&A in 2023 \\nIn 2023, companies that create shareholder value through M&A will need to deploy \\ncapital with the right balance of build vs. buy. In transactions, pharmaceutical and life \\nsciences companies may also need to strike the right combination of acquiring in-\\nline/Phase III products to meet near-term portfolio needs with longer-term (Phase I \\nand II) value creating pipeline assets. Combining this with an effective ecosystem to \\nwork with on both in-license and out-license R&D financing transactions can help \\nbolster top-line growth. And those companies that also leverage digital capabilities to \\nenhance both the front end of patient experience as well as product development, will \\ndrive value-creating capabilities in the longer term. \\n\\nWhile 2022 was a challenging year for PLS mergers and acquisitions (M&A) — the \\nindustry saw multiyear lows amid headwinds on multiple fronts, including risk-off \\nsentiment and market dislocation, we expect M&A in 2023 to revert to prior-year \\nlevels in terms of investment dollars and expect higher volume of transactions, \\nincluding strategic business partnerships, joint ventures and alliances. \\n\\nAreas of high expected future growth, such as oncology and immunology, will likely \\nsee growth, along with drugs targeting central nervous system and cardiovascular \\ndiseases. Vaccines are another place we believe the market will place a significant \\n\\n \\n \\n\\x0cpremium on therapeutic leadership. Biotech deals in the $5 billion to $15 billion range \\nwill be prevalent and will require a different set of strategies and market-leading \\ncapabilities across the M&A cycle. \\n\\nThe premium placed on category leadership necessitates proactive portfolio renewal \\nto help generate the highest relative shareholder returns. Prepared management \\nteams that divest businesses that are subscale while doubling down on areas where \\nleadership position and the right to win is tangible, may be positioned to deliver \\nsuperior returns. Additionally, with competition for mitigating risk science ever greater \\nand the pressure on drug pricing and deal models now better understood, the \\nimportance of building a vibrant ecosystem that enables the “not made here” agenda \\nis ever greater. Management teams that adopt these strategies at scale and remain \\nagile in 2023 are more likely to not only deliver above market returns, but also to \\nkeep activists at bay. \\n1Rome B, Won C, Kesselheim A. “Market exclusivity length for drugs with new generic or biosimilar \\ncompetition, 2012–2018.” Clinical Pharmacol. 2021;109(2)367-371. \\n\\nLearn more \\n\\n \\n\\x0c•  Pharmaceutical deals outlook looks bright for 2023 \\n•  8 critical success factors for biotech deals \\n•  PwC divestitures study \\n\\n \\n\\x0c', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\mmozafar\\\\OneDrive - Capgemini\\\\Projects\\\\GenAI_Hackathon\\\\pdf-convertor\\\\input\\\\pwc_pharma_2023.pdf'}), Document(page_content='Annual Report 2022\\n\\n\\x0c\\x0cWhy is access \\nto\\xa0healthcare \\nso\\xa0important?\\n\\nLife-changing innovation is only meaningful if it reaches \\n\\nthose who need it.

Sales \\nincreased by 2%* and net income amounted to \\n13.5\\xa0billion\\xa0Swiss\\xa0francs. The Board of Directors \\nproposes at the Annual General Meeting that \\nthe dividend be increased by 2% to 9.50\\xa0Swiss \\nfrancs per share and non-voting equity security, \\nthe\\xa036th\\xa0increase in succession.\\n\\nThe challenges of the past year have been \\nmanifold.\\xa0In particular, the war in Ukraine has \\nbrought unimaginable suffering to millions of \\npeople.\\xa0It is having a massive impact on the \\neconomy. At the same time, people around the \\nworld are still preoccupied with the consequences \\nof the COVID-19 pandemic.\\n\\nIn connection with the war in Ukraine, I was able to \\nexperience in a particularly impressive way how our \\nemployees are fully committed to providing patients \\nwith medicines and diagnostic tests. I am deeply \\ngrateful for the incredible helpfulness and initiative \\nof our employees across borders.\\n\\nCurrently, Roche has a total number of 87 new \\ncompounds and 65 additional indications in clinical \\ndevelopment or registration. And our Diagnostics \\nDivision is also flourishing thanks to the continuous \\ndevelopment of\\xa0new, innovative instruments and \\ntests. That is why\\xa0I am very confident about the \\nfuture of Roche. \\n\\nFor our innovations to reach people, we need \\nto work with our healthcare partners within \\neach country. Roche is engaged in hundreds \\nof partnerships and collaborations around the \\n\\nworld\\xa0to\\xa0improve access to our medicines and \\ndiagnostics, and thereby improve people’s lives.\\n\\nAn example of this is our partnership with Project \\nECHO, a non-profit organisation which uses video \\ntelementoring for medical education and care \\nmanagement. The project connects national \\ncentres\\xa0of excellence to remote and underserved \\nareas, giving patients access to specialised care \\nthat they otherwise wouldn’t receive.\\n\\nGood healthcare can be life-saving for patients \\nand creates enormous value for society as a whole. \\nImagine what it means when a person with cancer \\nis cured thanks to a timely, accurate diagnosis \\nand\\xa0effective treatment, and can continue to be \\naround for their family as well as contributing to \\nsociety and the economy. Early diagnosis can even \\nprevent illness altogether and thus avoid costly \\nhospital stays.\\n\\nI hope that access to modern and effective \\nhealthcare will one day be possible everywhere \\nin the world. Roche is making a significant \\ncontribution\\xa0here. \\n\\nThis is my final letter to you, esteemed shareholders \\nof Roche. After twelve years on the Board of \\nDirectors, including nine as Chairman, I have \\ndecided not to stand for re-election at the next \\nGeneral Meeting in 2023. With Severin Schwan \\nas the designated new Chairman of the Board of \\nDirectors and Thomas Schinecker as the new CEO, \\nRoche is being led into the future by a strong and \\nhighly experienced team.\\n\\n*    Unless otherwise stated, all growth rates and comparisons to the previous year are at constant exchange rates (CER; average rates 2021) and all total figures \\n\\nquoted are reported in CHF.\\n\\n\\x0c10\\n\\n“With Severin Schwan and Thomas Schinecker, \\nRoche is being led into the future by a strong \\nand highly experienced team.”\\n\\nI would like to thank Severin Schwan most \\nsincerely\\xa0for his outstanding achievements as \\nCEO of Roche over the last 15 years, as well as for \\nour always trusting and respectful cooperation. \\nSeverin\\xa0Schwan has contributed decisively to the \\nmajor success of your company. I would particularly \\nlike to\\xa0highlight the integration of Genentech, a \\nmilestone in the development of Roche. Equally \\nnoteworthy is the fact that our pharmaceuticals \\nbusiness has more than compensated for the loss \\nof patent protection\\xa0for our top-selling medicines \\nthanks to the introduction of new, innovative \\nproducts in\\xa0recent years. \\n\\nFinally, I am delighted that we are able to further \\nstrengthen the Board of Directors of Roche with \\ntwo key personalities: the Board of Directors \\nwill propose Mark Schneider, CEO of Nestlé, \\nand Akiko\\xa0Iwasaki, Professor of Immunobiology \\nand Molecular, Cellular and Developmental \\nBiology at Yale University and a researcher at \\nthe\\xa0Howard\\xa0Hughes Medical Institute, at the \\n2023 Annual General Meeting for election as \\nnew\\xa0Board\\xa0members.\\n\\nIt has been a great honour for me to work for this \\nunique and excellent company. Roche’s success is \\ndue in particular to the fact that the company has \\nbeen owned by the founder’s descendants for over \\n125\\xa0years. The owner families’ long-term orientation \\nenables the leadership of Roche to make the right \\ndecisions, so that the company can continue to \\nmake major contributions to people’s health for \\nmany years ahead. I therefore thank the owner \\nfamilies for their great support. \\n\\nI would also like in particular to thank all Roche \\nemployees for the significant medical advances we \\nhave achieved together. And thank you very much, \\ndear\\xa0shareholders, for your trust. \\n\\nDr Christoph Franz\\nChairman\\n\\n \\n\\x0cChairman’s shareholder letter \\n\\n|  Roche  11\\n\\nRoche Board of Directors on 31 December 2022  \\n\\nBernard Poussot (1952), C, E, G \\n\\nDr Jörg Duschmalé (1984), representative of the shareholder group with \\n\\npooled voting rights, B, E, G \\n\\nDr Christoph Franz (1960), Chairman, C, D*, E, G \\n\\nAndré Hoffmann (1958), Vice-Chairman, representative of the shareholder \\n\\ngroup with pooled voting rights, A*, C*, D, E, G \\n\\nDr Severin Schwan (1967), F \\n\\nDr Claudia Suessmuth Dyckerhoff (1967), A, B, E, G\\n\\nDr Patrick Frost (1968), B*, C, E, G \\n\\nAnita Hauser (1969), A, E, G \\n\\nProf. Dr Richard P.

After twelve\\xa0years on the Board of \\nDirectors and nine\\xa0years as its Chairman, Christoph \\nFranz has decided not to stand for re-election.\\n\\nThere is no doubt that, throughout his tenure, our \\noutgoing Chairman has strongly influenced Roche’s \\nstrategic development. He has made a considerable \\npersonal contribution to the success of our \\ncompany. Although he joined Roche from elsewhere \\nin 2011, Christoph Franz was able to make valuable \\ncontributions to the Board of Directors from the \\noutset. This was undoubtedly a result of his many \\nyears of experience in international companies. \\nTogether with the Board of Directors and the \\nExecutive Committee, he did not simply manage \\nproblems, but tackled them promptly and provided \\nconstructive solutions. In so doing, he confidently \\nand successfully steered our company through \\nchallenging times with great dedication. Examples \\nI would like to mention here include Roche’s \\ncontribution during the pandemic and handling \\nthe\\xa0patent expiry of our three most widely used \\ncancer medicines.\\n\\nIn addition, Christoph Franz made an important \\ncontribution to expanding Roche’s strategic \\nflexibility by repurchasing the Roche shares held \\nby Novartis. Since he took on the top role at Roche, \\ndigitalisation in the healthcare sector has also \\naccelerated – and alongside it, a far-reaching \\ntransformation of our company. Roche today is \\nclearly different from Roche a decade ago. \\n\\nGiving people worldwide access to our medicines \\nand diagnostics has always been one of \\nChristoph\\xa0Franz’s particular concerns. During \\nhis travels to Roche subsidiaries in Africa, Asia \\nand South America, he therefore always took the \\ntime to visit local hospitals and to talk to doctors, \\nlocal nursing staff and patients. Together with \\nlocal government representatives, he effected \\na remarkable number of agreements between \\nRoche\\xa0and governments around the world, with \\nthe\\xa0aim of working together to improve local \\nhealthcare systems.\\n\\nI have personally always appreciated that \\nChristoph\\xa0Franz, with his wealth of entrepreneurial \\nexperience and wide-ranging knowledge, has \\nadvocated not only obvious solutions but also\\xa0– \\nand\\xa0in particular – some challenging choices \\nthat were, and still are, key to\\xa0safeguarding \\nRoche’s\\xa0future.\\n\\nOn behalf of the entire Board of Directors, the\\nOeri, Hoffmann and Duschmalé families, and myself, \\nI would like to sincerely thank our Chairman for all \\nof this.\\n\\nAndré Hoffmann \\nVice-Chairman of the Board of Directors\\n\\n\\x0cLetter of the Vice-Chairman \\n\\n|  Roche  13\\n\\nAndré Hoffmann\\n\\n\\x0c14\\n\\nDr Severin Schwan\\n\\n\\x0cShareholder letter CEO Roche Group \\n\\n|  Roche  15\\n\\nDear Shareholders\\n\\nOverall, we achieved good results last year. This \\nis primarily due to the continued strong demand \\nfor routine diagnostics and our newer medicines \\nto treat serious diseases such as multiple sclerosis, \\nhaemophilia, severe eye diseases, spinal muscular \\natrophy and cancer.\\n\\nThe development and delivery of pioneering \\nmedicines and diagnostics is at the heart of our \\nmission. Innovations from Roche improve the lives \\nof people worldwide: in 2022, 29 billion tests were \\nperformed with our diagnostic products, delivering \\ncrucial information on disease prevention, diagnosis \\nand treatment. And millions of patients were treated \\nwith Roche medicines.\\n\\nI am particularly pleased with our recent successes \\nin ophthalmology: Vabysmo is a novel treatment \\nfor certain severe eye diseases. Launched at the \\nbeginning of 2022, a large number of patients \\nalready have access to this innovative eye medicine. \\nVabysmo became one of our most important growth \\ndrivers in\\xa0just a few months.  \\n\\nLast year, we were also able to provide patients \\nwith two important medicines for blood cancer. \\nLunsumio gives hope to people with a certain form \\nof follicular lymphoma. This blood cancer develops \\nslowly, but has been incurable up to now. Our new \\nimmunotherapy activates the body’s own immune \\nsystem – a promising new approach to blood cancer. \\nPolivy significantly improves the chances of curing \\na particularly aggressive form of blood cancer. \\nFor two decades, research in this area made little \\nprogress, so this is a real medical breakthrough. \\n\\nAnother highlight: our cancer immunotherapy \\nTecentriq has now also been approved in Europe \\nand other countries for the treatment of early-\\nstage lung cancer. For many people this raises \\nthe\\xa0prospect of a cure. \\n\\nInnovative research and development does not \\nonly carry opportunities, but also risks. In addition \\nto many successes, we also experienced setbacks \\nlast year – first and foremost the disappointing \\nstudy data on gantenerumab in the treatment \\nof Alzheimer’s disease. Such setbacks are not \\na reason\\xa0to give up, but part of the often long, \\niterative research and development processes \\nin our industry. We learn from the study data \\nand implement these lessons in the next study. \\nRoche has other molecules against Alzheimer’s \\nin development. We will continue to have the \\nentrepreneurial courage to invest in particularly \\nhigh-risk research areas such as Alzheimer’s and \\nhope that we will ultimately achieve a breakthrough \\nfor patients. \\n\\nInnovative diagnostic solutions enable early and \\nreliable decision-making, whether in infectious \\ndiseases, cancer or other diseases. With the PCR \\ntest kits developed in record time for the detection \\nof the mpox virus, we have proven once again – after \\nCOVID-19 – that we are able to respond quickly to \\nnew public health threats. \\n\\nCertain human papillomaviruses (HPV) may \\ncause\\xa0cervical cancer. Our new HPV self-sampling \\nsolution\\xa0offers women the possibility to take \\nthe cervical samples needed for HPV testing \\n\\n\\x0c16\\n\\nRoche Corporate Executive Committee on 31 December 2022 \\n\\nDr Alan Hippe (1967), Chief Financial and Information Officer\\n\\nClaudia Böckstiegel* (1964), General Counsel\\n\\nDr Aviv Regev* (1971), Head Genentech Research and Early Development (gRED)\\n\\nProf. Dr Hans Clevers* (1957), Head Roche Pharma Research and Early Development (pRED)\\n\\nDr\\xa0Severin Schwan (1967), CEO Roche Group\\n\\nCristina A.

This \\nsolution can help break\\xa0down barriers to screening \\nfor cervical cancer. The new HCV Duo assay can \\nalso help prevent cancer, as well as other diseases \\ncaused by hepatitis\\xa0C. The\\xa0assay provides both \\nantigen and\\xa0antibody results in one test, thus \\nhelping diagnose hepatitis\\xa0C\\xa0faster. \\n\\nWe have also further expanded our digital \\nhealth\\xa0business. For example, our new digital \\nsolution for pathology now delivers high-resolution \\ndigital images of tissue samples even faster. The \\nevaluation is not carried out using a microscope, \\nbut\\xa0electronically. Artificial intelligence now often \\nsees more than the human eye. This makes it easier \\nto diagnose cancer and enables more targeted \\nand\\xa0effective treatment for the patient concerned.\\n\\nIn fragmented healthcare systems, medical \\nknowledge is often untapped today because \\nof inadequate digitalisation.

It contains the annual financial \\nstatements, consolidated financial statements and \\nnon-financial performance indicators. It covers \\nall regions and divisions of the Roche Group from \\n1\\xa0January to 31 December 2022. The financial \\nreporting scope is defined and outlined in our \\nFinance Report, and there have been no significant \\nchanges in scope in 2022 compared to 2021.\\n\\nGRI Standards and materiality\\nWe have been a member of the Global Reporting \\nInitiative (GRI) community since 2007, have \\nfollowed the GRI G4 guidelines since 2014 and \\nhave transitioned to reporting with reference to the \\n2016 GRI Standards. By using the GRI Standards, we \\ndisclose the most critical impacts of our activities \\non the environment, society and the economy.\\n\\nRisk management\\nOur Risk Management Policy sets out Roche’s \\napproach to identifying, analysing, managing \\nand reporting internal and external risks and \\nopportunities. A consolidated Group Risk Report, \\nwhich covers all material risks and opportunities, is \\ndiscussed annually with the Corporate Executive \\nCommittee and reviewed by the Board of Directors. \\n\\nThe effectiveness of the Group Risk Management \\nProcess is regularly monitored by the Group Risk \\nAdvisory team and the overall process reviewed \\nby the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, \\n\\nand reviewed externally when appropriate. \\nRisk\\xa0management is embedded at all levels of the \\nRoche Group. Our Pharmaceuticals and Diagnostics \\nDivisions and global functions conduct a formal \\nrisk\\xa0and opportunity assessment at least once a \\nyear and must develop response plans for their \\nmost\\xa0material risks and opportunities. \\n\\nRead more in ‘Corporate Governance’ on page\\xa0158.\\n\\nWe also identify long-term business sustainability \\ntrends with associated risks and opportunities on \\nan annual basis and integrate these into our existing \\nGroup Risk Management Process. Each year, ten \\nemerging trends (including associated risks and \\nopportunities) are identified from internal and \\nexternal sources. \\n\\nBased on these findings, the Sustainability Steering \\nCommittee prioritises and selects the top business \\nsustainability trends. The two most important \\nbusiness sustainability trends for 2022 are the \\nfollowing: i) Future of work and ii) Mistrust and \\nscepticism in science. These two trends, as well \\nas\\xa0one of their associated opportunities and risks, \\nare described on page 31. \\n\\nUN Sustainable Development Goals\\nWe support the United Nations Sustainable \\nDevelopment Goals (SDGs) within the sphere of our \\ncorporate business strategy.

We do this by developing \\nnew medicines and ways of diagnosing disease \\nand gaining\\xa0insights from data. Our commitment to \\nexpand\\xa0access to these innovations will help more \\npatients live longer, better lives. And with this comes \\na deep respect for the human rights of everyone \\nwe reach, especially patients, business partners, \\nsuppliers, local communities and, of course, our \\ncolleagues around the world. It is why we emphasise \\nemployee safety, health and development while \\npromoting diversity and inclusion, integrity, mutual \\nrespect and equal opportunities for all. \\n\\nEnvironment\\nThe respect for a healthy planet and for the \\nenvironment has always been a priority of our \\nfounding families and the company.

As an 18-year-old college student in \\nJapan, Hiro developed a passion for all aspects of \\nhistology – the study of tissues. He spent his days \\ndissecting samples, analysing data and eventually \\npublishing the findings that now serve as the \\nfoundation for scientists involved in developing \\nstate-of-the-art tissue-based diagnostics.\\n\\naccurately diagnose HER2-positive patients, \\nanywhere in the world. He succeeded.\\n\\nJust the beginning \\nAfter the new diagnostic was launched, Hiro’s \\ncommitment only deepened. “Missing one patient \\nwho could be receiving life-saving therapy is one \\ntoo many,” Hiro says. His new goal was to develop \\neven more precise diagnostics.\\n\\nThose early academic days were only the beginning \\nof Hiro’s decades-long commitment to developing \\neven more precise diagnostics for HER2-positive \\nbreast cancer patients. It’s a journey Hiro considers \\nto be his life’s work. In 2000, Hiro began working \\nfor Ventana Medical Systems, which was acquired \\nby Roche in 2008. Today, he is a Senior Scientific \\nFellow in Clinical Development and Medical Affairs \\nat the Roche Diagnostics Solutions campus in \\nTucson, Arizona. And he has no plans of slowing \\ndown any time soon. As Hiro explains, “We have \\nso\\xa0much more\\xa0to do for patients. There’s no time \\nto\\xa0waste.”\\n\\nHiro’s work at Roche enabled him to follow his \\npassion of developing diagnostics to address unmet \\npatient needs. He has created a next-generation \\nHER2 test that can determine which specific type of \\ncells are present in a tumour. That valuable insight \\nis used to inform new therapy protocols and could \\neventually enable more HER2-positive patients to \\nexperience better outcomes. \\n\\nHiro has also discovered a previously unknown type \\nof tumour cell structure and is working with other \\nbreast cancer researchers to investigate how this \\ntype of tumour responds to targeted therapy.\\n\\nWhat is HER2? \\nAs many as 20% of the 2.3 million cases of breast \\ncancer diagnosed globally each year are fuelled \\nby the HER2 gene.1,2 Many HER2-positive patients \\ncan benefit from a specific targeted therapy. But \\ndetermining which patients should receive the \\ntreatments initially required highly specialised \\ntechnology. “Some women didn’t get the right \\ntreatment because of challenges with testing,” \\nHiro\\xa0says. “I wasn’t okay with that.”\\n\\nWhile working at Ventana, Hiro dedicated \\nhimself to\\xa0developing a simpler test that could \\nbe conducted in any lab and could quickly and \\n\\nAt the same time, he is developing tests that\\xa0will \\nprovide valuable information that cannot be \\nobtained through the diagnostics currently \\navailable. In 2022, Hiro’s research on the novel \\nassay which evaluates both the HER2 gene and \\nHER2 protein with a single tissue sample was \\npresented at meetings of the United States and \\nCanadian Academy of Pathology as well as the \\nEuropean Society for Medical Oncology.\\n\\nAccess has multiple elements \\nFor Hiro, improving access means that all cancer \\npatients have the opportunity to be tested with \\nthe most innovative and accurate methods, and \\n\\n1  Breast cancer fact sheet 2021, World Health Organization\\n\\n2   Recommendations for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 testing in breast cancer: American Society of Clinical Oncology/College of American Pathologists \\n\\nclinical practice guideline update Journal of Clinical Oncology\\n\\n\\x0c44\\n\\n“Everyone deserves access to the best cancer \\ndiagnostic tools and therapies, so they can \\nhave more time with the people they love.”\\n\\nthose results can then be used to select the \\ntreatment protocol that can most effectively \\nsave\\xa0or\\xa0extend\\xa0their lives. Hiro describes his \\ncommitment this way:\\n\\n“It shouldn’t matter where someone lives or how \\nmuch money they have. Everyone deserves \\naccess\\xa0to the best cancer diagnostic tools and \\ntherapies, so they can have more time with the \\npeople they love. To help make that goal a reality \\nI\\xa0will continue working on developing better and \\nmore precise tissue-based cancer diagnostics \\nfor\\xa0as\\xa0long as I can.”\\n\\nInspiration, everywhere \\nWhile Hiro’s accomplishments begin in his \\nlaboratory,\\xa0he knows the impact of his work \\nhappens\\xa0outside those doors. Hiro can be found \\nin cancer treatment facilities around the world, \\nmeeting with research collaborators. These visits \\nprovide the invaluable opportunity to connect \\nwith\\xa0cancer patients and their family members. \\nEven\\xa0a casual conversation in\\xa0the lobby of a \\nhospital\\xa0helps\\xa0Hiro maintain his focus on the \\nultimate beneficiaries of his work. \\n\\nBy getting to know patients as people, he can \\nbetter \\xa0understand their individual journeys, the \\nchallenges they face and their hopes for the \\nfuture.\\xa0“When we focus on patients,” Hiro explains, \\n“we know\\xa0what we\\xa0must do.”\\n\\nHiro has another unique perspective that inspires \\nhis work. In March of 2021, he experienced a \\ndangerously severe COVID-19 infection. At one \\n\\npoint, he was not expected to survive. He considers \\nhis eventual recovery to be an invaluable second \\nchance to continue his work and to do even more \\nfor\\xa0patients. Here is how Hiro explains the impact \\nof\\xa0his experience: \\n\\n“I understand now, more than ever, the fear and hope \\npatients feel, and their worry over limited treatment \\noptions. I got a second chance to live. I believe I \\nsurvived so I could work harder than ever to give \\ncancer patients their second chance. That is what \\nthis experience has left me with, and what drives \\nme\\xa0to make a greater difference.”\\n\\nHiro still needs to manage his life due to symptoms \\nof long COVID. This further reminds him of the \\nneed\\xa0for better testing and treatment choices for \\nall\\xa0patients.\\n\\nA life in full \\nAs committed as Hiro is to his work, he does have \\ninterests outside of the lab. He is an award-winning \\nmagician and performs for children in hospital \\npaediatric units. He also raises standard poodles, \\nand shows them in competition. Add to that a love \\nof\\xa0Disney and a talent for baking, and Hiro looks to \\nbe the very definition of a well-rounded individual \\nwith a passion-filled life. \\n\\nHiro’s many scientific breakthroughs have already \\nimpacted the lives of millions of patients around \\nthe world. His commitment to reaching even more \\npeople with the highly precise diagnostics that \\ncan\\xa0lead to more effective treatments continues \\nto\\xa0drive\\xa0him, every day.\\n\\n\\x0cDiagnostics \\n\\n|  Roche  45\\n\\nIn his quest to continuously improve breast cancer diagnosis, \\n\\nHiro\\xa0Nitta spends his days investigating cancer cells.

Reading his medical books as a child \\ninstilled a love of science and a drive to follow in \\nher father’s footsteps. Despite being a female in \\na predominantly male-dominated field, Dr\\xa0Jamil \\nstudied various areas of medicine in both Pakistan \\nand the United Kingdom, and is now a Professor \\nof Medicine and Infectious Diseases at Aga Khan \\nUniversity Hospital (AKU) in Karachi, Pakistan, and \\nalso the President of the Medical Microbiology & \\nInfectious Diseases Society of Pakistan (MMIDSP).\\n\\nDiagnostics infrastructure is key \\nA great deal of Dr Jamil’s work at both AKU and \\nMMIDSP is focused on increasing access to quality \\nhealthcare in Pakistan. “The lack of an effective \\nhealthcare delivery system is a huge challenge in \\nPakistan,” says Dr Jamil. “Although it varies from \\nprovince to province, the system is extremely \\nfragmented and of poor quality. There is an urgent \\nneed to invest to close the gaps, particularly as \\nit relates to accessing diagnostics services and \\nadequately training healthcare professionals.”\\n\\nA move towards patient-centred care \\nThe lack of a patient-centred system is also a \\nsignificant challenge that Dr\\xa0Jamil sees as a critical \\ngap. “If a patient requires a number of different \\ntests, they are often sent to different clinics in \\ndifferent areas rather than having basic diagnostics \\navailable under one roof. This is incredibly \\ninconvenient for patients and is something we \\nneed\\xa0to address.”\\n\\nIn 2021, Dr Jamil served as National Coordinator \\nfor the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis \\nand Malaria grants with the Ministry of Health in \\nIslamabad. She procured the COVID-19 mitigation \\ngrant with a focus on strengthening health systems \\nand ensuring provision of integrated care\\xa0and \\ncritical diagnostics all under one\\xa0roof. “This is \\nthe\\xa0type of clinical service which is needed\\xa0across \\nthe country,” says Dr\\xa0Jamil. “While COVID-19 \\nserved\\xa0as\\xa0a catalyst for funding, we now have \\nthe\\xa0ability to\\xa0diagnose other infectious diseases \\nusing the same equipment. This\\xa0is the model \\nthat will\\xa0truly\\xa0move the\\xa0needle when it comes to \\npatient\\xa0care.”\\n\\nUnfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated \\nthese issues and brought about the realisation that \\na robust diagnostics infrastructure, for COVID-19 \\nand other infectious diseases, is absolutely \\nessential. “Diseases are not being diagnosed at \\nan early stage and when patients are eventually \\ndiagnosed, there is not always a defined path for \\nthem to take, especially if they live in a rural area. \\nSome patients will have to go to a private clinic if \\nthey need urgent treatment.”\\n\\nRoche has been working with Dr\\xa0Jamil to ensure \\nthat\\xa0district level secondary care hospitals are \\nequipped with the diagnostics systems needed to \\nprovide this one-stop-shop approach. “If we have \\nthe right equipment, we need to use it in the most \\neffective and efficient way possible,” says Dr\\xa0Jamil. \\n“This will have a huge impact on case detection as \\nwell as follow-up treatment, not to mention the \\nfact\\xa0that if it’s done easily and conveniently, the \\npatient will greatly benefit.” \\n\\n\\x0cDiagnostics \\n\\n|  Roche  47\\n\\nDr Bushra Jamil\\n\\n\\x0c48\\n\\nAs an infectious disease expert, Dr Jamil knows the important \\n\\nrole diagnostics play in the detection and treatment of diseases \\n\\nsuch as tuberculosis, HIV and malaria. Once critical diagnostics \\n\\ninfrastructures are in place, they can dramatically change the \\n\\nquality and timeliness of care patients receive.\\n\\n\\x0cDiagnostics \\n\\n|  Roche  49\\n\\n“We need to be able to bring diagnostics \\nthat are available, affordable, simple and \\nfast into\\xa0the public healthcare system in \\nan\\xa0economical manner.”\\n\\nEducation is key \\nAnother important component of increasing \\nquality\\xa0of care for patients in Pakistan is properly \\ntraining healthcare professionals on the principles \\nof effective diagnostics and management of \\ndiseases. “When a workforce is inadequately trained, \\nthey tend to bypass essential steps and patients are \\ntreated based on previous experience rather than \\non accurate diagnostics,” says Dr\\xa0Jamil. “This can \\nbe harmful to the patient because the treatment is \\nnot based on accurate and timely diagnostics. This \\nalso has negative implications for the community \\nand the country as a whole.”\\n\\nIn 2022, Roche Diagnostics Pakistan partnered \\nwith Dr Jamil and the MMIDSP to increase advocacy \\naround diagnostics and enable improved patient \\naccess in order to minimise the country’s disease \\nimpact. This partnership will deliver continuing \\n\\nmedical education opportunities for healthcare \\nprofessionals and execute disease awareness and \\neducation campaigns to emphasise the significance \\nof timely diagnosis and treatment for prevention \\nand\\xa0management across a variety of disease areas. \\n\\nA look to the future\\nWhen asked what the future could look like \\nfor healthcare in Pakistan, Dr\\xa0Jamil’s answer is \\nclear: “Public-private partnerships are critical. \\nWe need to be able to bring diagnostics that are \\navailable, affordable, simple and fast into the \\npublic\\xa0healthcare system in an economical manner. \\nWe can then work together to train the workforce \\nand build these diagnostics capabilities into our \\nprocedures for improved patient journeys. I am \\nconfident that implementing these changes can \\ntruly make a difference in the lives of the people \\nof\\xa0Pakistan.”\\n\\n\\x0c50\\n\\nIntegrated solutions to improve \\noutcomes\\n\\nFor our Diagnostics Division, 2022 was marked \\nby three key trends. First, global awareness of \\nthe value of diagnostics across every aspect \\nof healthcare grew significantly. Our COVID-19 \\nportfolio continued to expand to meet demands \\nrelated to the disease’s evolution. Second, we \\nalso saw measurable growth in our base business, \\nsuch as tests for cancer, cardiovascular disease, \\ninfectious diseases – and more. Third, we advanced \\nour efforts to build a sustainable digital health \\nbusiness that will set us\\xa0up\\xa0for success\\xa0in a more \\ndigitalised market.\\n\\nFrom preventative screening to follow-up care\\nDiagnostics play an increasingly critical role across \\nthe entire patient journey. With early diagnosis, \\ndisease progression may be slowed or even stopped. \\nDiagnostic testing can provide patients, families and \\nhealthcare professionals with information that may \\nlead to the best possible outcome. For healthcare \\nsystems, access to diagnostic information for \\nmanaging diseases helps\\xa0avoid unnecessary service \\ndelivery, reduces overall cost of care, improves its \\neffectiveness and,\\xa0most importantly, contributes \\nto\\xa0saving lives.\\n\\nAs demonstrated by the COVID-19 pandemic, \\ndiagnostics and information solutions can make a \\nmajor difference in a country’s ability to cope with \\ninfectious disease outbreaks and maintain health \\nsystems. Advanced diagnostic solutions support \\nearlier decision-making, help reduce hospitalisation, \\nenable targeted treatment strategies and improve \\npatient management.\\n\\nDriving innovation through digitalisation\\nWe have been building our division-wide digital \\nfoundation, strategy and portfolio, further \\nadvancing our ambition to establish a sustainable \\ndigital health business. In 2022, we unified \\nour digital health portfolio under the navify \\nbrand, providing a range of next-generation \\nsoftware\\xa0solutions. \\n\\nThrough our Digital Pathology portfolio, we are \\ntransforming pathology. The VENTANA DP\\xa0600 \\nhigh-capacity slide scanner creates high-resolution \\ndigital images of stained tissue samples to help \\ndiagnose cancer and determine a patient’s \\ntreatment. The Digital Pathology Open Environment \\nallows software developers to easily integrate \\ntheir\\xa0image analysis tools for tumour tissue with \\nour\\xa0uPath\\xa0enterprise software.\\n\\nOpen digital ecosystems connect innovators, \\nfrom start-ups to technology leaders, to give \\nlab professionals, clinicians, researchers and \\npatients faster access to a wider range of \\ninnovation. This further advances our personalised \\nhealthcare solutions. Over time, the thousands \\nof data\\xa0points patients create throughout their \\njourney will help identify changes in their health \\nand enable tracking of similar patient groups across \\ninstitutions and geographies. Through artificial \\nintelligence\\xa0(AI)\\xa0and machine learning, this will \\neventually\\xa0allow for comparison of outcomes as \\nwell\\xa0as predictive\\xa0measures.\\n\\nMoreover, we are carefully assessing the diversity \\nof patient populations in all our diagnostics clinical \\ntrials, demonstrating our commitment to developing \\nsolutions that help to improve outcomes for patients \\naround the world. For example, our Diagnostics \\nDivision is contributing in a very meaningful way to \\nthe Roche-wide Africa Genomics Program (AGP). \\n\\nIn Diabetes Care, we are advancing our integrated \\nPersonalised Diabetes Management (iPDM) \\nstrategy. We successfully deployed the Customer \\nPopulation Insights Dashboard to streamline the \\ndata management process and enable healthcare \\nprofessionals, administrators and payers to view \\npopulation level trends. In time for the 10th \\nanniversary of mySugr, the patient-centric interface \\nat the core of our open ecosystem, we introduced \\nextended functionalities and expanded smartphone \\ncompatibility

in Kenya. \\n\\nThe\\xa0programme is an important step for Kenyan women \\n\\nwith breast cancer to access standard-of-care treatment. \\n\\n\\x0cPharmaceuticals \\n\\n|  Roche  57\\n\\nRicky  \\n

His work has \\n\\nresulted in a new and transformative way to provide direct-\\n\\nto-patient treatment delivery and home care services.\\n\\n\\x0c58\\n\\nFrankline Akinyi\\xa0Otieno\\n\\n\\x0cPharmaceuticals \\n\\n|  Roche  59\\n\\nOvercoming challenges to accessing breast \\ncancer treatment in Kenya\\n\\nAs a peer educator at the Centre for Health \\nSolutions facility in Ukwala town, Kenya, Frankline \\nAkinyi Otieno works with women to educate and \\nsupport them on a range of health issues. For \\nthe past six years she has been visiting women in \\nthe community to speak about reproductive and \\nsexual\\xa0health, including topics such as sexually \\ntransmitted infections and family planning. Frankline \\nalso educates women on how to perform breast \\nself-examinations and encourages them to go for \\ncervical cancer screenings. \\n\\nWhile her role requires extensive knowledge on \\nthese topics, Frankline had already learned long \\nago\\xa0the importance of self-examinations and \\nscreening from observing posters at the hospital \\nthat she used to visit frequently for her asthma. \\nRoutinely performing breast self-examinations \\nproved to be a\\xa0critically important practice in her \\nown life when she found a lump herself.\\n\\nFrankline immediately consulted her doctor and \\nwas\\xa0referred to a specialist at Jaramogi Oginga \\nOdinga Teaching and Referral Hospital (JOOTRH) \\nfor further investigation. Following an ultrasound, \\nmammogram and biopsy, in May 2021 Frankline \\nwas\\xa0told that she had breast cancer. \\n\\nExploring alternative treatment options\\n“It was a huge shock hearing that I had breast \\ncancer,” she recalls. “I really wasn’t expecting it \\nbecause I was breastfeeding at the time, and prior \\nto this, the tests I had done indicated that the\\xa0lump \\nwas normal. I was told it would subside with\\xa0time.” \\n\\nUpon hearing her diagnosis, Frankline was hesitant \\nto follow the recommended hospital treatment \\nbecause she was afraid of the potential effects \\n\\non her well-being. She also faced stigma from \\nfamily, friends and colleagues, which amplified her \\nconcerns. “They told me that cancer is expensive \\nand that people don’t survive chemotherapy.” \\n\\nHer family had a difficult time accepting the \\ncancer\\xa0diagnosis and they were also concerned \\nabout the medical treatment, insisting that she \\nfirst try herbal medicine. Although Frankline had \\nreservations, she tried this option for two months. \\nUltimately the herbal medicine didn’t work, so \\nFrankline returned to JOOTRH to proceed with the \\nrecommended treatment plan from the doctors.\\n\\nConfronted by access challenges \\nFrankline underwent a mastectomy, followed by \\neight cycles of chemotherapy. The impact on her \\nlife\\xa0was indeed significant. “It was not an easy \\njourney for me,” she says. “I had never had surgery \\nbefore and I really wasn’t comfortable. I got quite \\nsick from the chemotherapy and my arm became \\nconstrained after the surgery. I couldn’t lift heavy \\nobjects, hang clothes to dry on the line, or sleep on \\nmy right side. People started seeing me differently \\nand my self-esteem suffered as a result.”\\n\\nFollowing the surgery and chemotherapy, \\nFrankline\\xa0was to continue with hormonal \\ntreatment. Her treatments had been covered by \\nthe National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF) up until \\nthis point, but\\xa0now she was faced with a difficult \\ndecision. “The\\xa0NHIF covered the mastectomy and \\nchemotherapy, as well as the first four hormonal \\ntreatments, but after that I needed to pay for \\nthe remaining 14\\xa0treatments,” Frankline explains. \\n“I\\xa0couldn’t afford it and I didn’t know what to do \\nnext.\\xa0I was stuck, so I had to stop my treatment \\nfor\\xa0two months while I weighed my\\xa0options.”\\n\\n\\x0c60\\n\\n“I want to advocate for all women to get \\nscreened; the earlier the better so you can \\nget\\xa0the right diagnosis and treatment.”\\n\\nSoon Frankline had her answer. In June 2022, the \\nMinistry of Health in Kenya, the NHIF and Roche \\nannounced a partnership to make breast cancer \\ntreatment available to all NHIF members in Kenya. \\nThis was the first national access programme for \\ncancer medicines in Kenya, and an important step \\nto ease the financial burden of Kenyan women with \\nbreast cancer and ensure they have access to \\nstandard-of-care treatment. \\n\\nBreast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed \\ncancer in Kenya, with 6,000\\xa0cases diagnosed \\neach year and 2,500\\xa0breast cancer-related \\ndeaths.1 Through this partnership, Roche is \\nhelping strengthen the diagnostic ecosystem for \\nbreast cancer screening and early diagnosis of \\npatients, as\\xa0well as improve the referral pathways \\nto treatment centres so that women can get the \\ntreatment they need in a timely manner. \\n\\nFor Frankline, this welcome news meant that she \\ndid\\xa0not have to worry about paying out of pocket \\nand that she could continue with her treatment. \\n“This made it easier for me because I could now \\nget\\xa0my full treatment covered.”\\n\\nA bright future\\nWhile Frankline is thankful that she was able to \\naccess her treatment, she also recognises the \\nimportance of her own knowledge and the impact \\nof screening. “The self-examination saved my life,” \\nshe says. “I want to advocate for all women to get \\nscreened; the earlier the better so you can get \\nthe right diagnosis and treatment. Cancer doesn’t \\nhave to be a death sentence as long as you get \\nthe\\xa0diagnosis early enough.” \\n\\nToday, Frankline is responding well to the \\ntreatment\\xa0and she is optimistic about what her \\nfuture holds. “I\\xa0believe that all my dreams for \\nthe future will go as planned and that I will live a \\nnormal\\xa0life,” she says. \\n\\nA big part of that future is helping her son \\nrealise\\xa0his\\xa0own dreams. “My son is my comfort; \\nwhen\\xa0I am sick, he tells me all will be well. So \\nI\\xa0want\\xa0the very best for him,” says Frankline. \\n“He\\xa0wants to be a pilot\\xa0when he grows up, and I \\nhope to help him with his education. I know I will \\nlive and see\\xa0that happen,\\xa0and\\xa0he can fly me all \\naround\\xa0the\\xa0world.”\\n\\n1   Cancer on the Global Stage: Incidence and Cancer-Related Mortality in Kenya. World Health Organization Region: Africa, The ASCO Post\\n\\n\\x0cPharmaceuticals \\n\\n|  Roche  61\\n\\nLike many women with breast cancer in Kenya, Frankline faced \\n\\nfinancial challenges that prevented her from getting the medicine \\n\\nshe needed. A new collaboration between the Ministry of Health \\n\\nin Kenya, the NHIF and Roche has made breast cancer treatment \\n\\navailable, making it easier and more accessible for women like \\n\\nFrankline to receive standard-of-care treatment. Now Frankline \\n\\nis\\xa0doing well and looks forward to a bright future with her son.\\n\\n\\x0c62\\n\\nImproving access to treatment for patients \\nfrom\\xa0the comfort of their own home\\n\\nWhen Ricky Alas worked as a consultant in digital \\ninnovation and corporate venture building in \\nSan Francisco, he was exposed to a number of \\nindustries, ranging from financial services to \\nconsumer packaged goods. But after ten years, \\nRicky was ready for a change. Of all the industries \\nhe’d worked in, he was most drawn to healthcare. \\nHe wanted to be part of an organisation that had \\na direct and tangible impact on improving people’s \\nlives, so in 2019 he joined Genentech as a Digital \\nTransformation Lead in Global Supply Chain. \\n\\nShortly after settling in, Ricky was given the \\nopportunity to work on a project called Integrated \\nDirect Delivery to Patients, or ID2P, where the \\nvalue for patients was clear. ID2P stemmed from \\nan exercise to answer the question: “What would \\nthe healthcare system look like if it was designed \\naround what patients and their family members \\nneeded and wanted so they could make the most \\nof\\xa0their life?” \\n\\nThe initial thinking was to improve some of the \\nprocesses in healthcare delivery to better support \\npatients and caregivers, and simplify how they \\nget treatments. The key solution pointed to direct-\\nto-patient delivery and home care services, and \\nthus ID2P was born. If successful, the project \\nwould improve the quality of healthcare service to \\npatients and family members, alleviate hospital and \\nclinic burden by reducing the number of in-person \\npatient visits, and improve outcomes for patients \\nthrough greater convenience and potentially better \\ntreatment adherence. \\n\\nMeeting patients where they are \\nWhile home delivery of consumer goods – from pizza \\nto appliances – is part of our everyday life, home \\n\\ndelivery of specialty medicine is still uncommon. \\nAnd yet it can make a significant improvement \\nin a patient’s quality of life while also having the \\npotential to save healthcare costs through more \\nefficient processes and delivery of treatment. \\n\\nRicky and the global ID2P team were initially \\ntasked\\xa0with finding a way to make home delivery \\nof Evrysdi, an oral treatment for spinal muscular \\natrophy (SMA), a reality – no small feat considering \\nnothing like this existed for a medicine that would \\ntypically have to be picked up from a specialty \\ntreatment centre, which could be hours from a \\npatient’s home. They set out to create a solution \\nthat was “desirable to patients and the ecosystem, \\nfeasible and viable,” according to Ricky. “It felt \\nalmost like a start-up. There are very few times \\nyou get to build a new business in an established \\ncompany, and\\xa0for Roche to give us that opportunity \\nwas amazing.”\\n\\n“If you think about Roche’s ambition to provide more \\nbenefit to patients at less cost to society, ID2P does \\nexactly that,” says Ricky. “I’m proud to work for an \\norganisation that not only has such ambitious goals, \\nbut also comes up with new and creative ideas to \\nachieve them. We don’t always know what will work \\nbut we are always trying to find ways to improve \\npeople’s lives.” \\n\\nWhen the programme was launched in 2020, the \\ninterest from offices around the world to participate \\nwas overwhelmingly positive. However, the road \\nahead was challenging as the team forged new \\npaths in every direction – from legal and regulatory \\nrequirements to supply and logistics solutions – \\nwhile also taking into account stakeholder needs \\nand preferences. “It was such an unknown and \\n\\n\\x0cPharmaceuticals \\n\\n|  Roche  63\\n\\nRicky Alas\\n\\n\\x0c64\\n\\nRicky and the ID2P team work with colleagues around the globe to \\n\\ndesign, develop and implement tailored programmes that enable \\n\\ndelivery of treatments directly to patients in their own homes. \\n\\nThis convenient solution can save countless hours of travel time \\n\\nto specialty hospitals which, for patients with rare and chronic \\n\\nconditions like SMA or haemophilia and their caregivers, can be \\n\\nlife-changing.\\n\\n\\x0cPharmaceuticals \\n\\n|  Roche  65\\n\\n“I believe that the evolution of healthcare \\nis going to continue towards a much more \\npatient-centric realm.”\\n\\nunconstrained space,” recalls Ricky. “There was \\nno\\xa0road map or industry barometer for success. \\nWe were figuring it out as we went and when we hit \\nroadblocks, they were amplified because we only \\nhad ourselves to look at.” Despite the challenges, \\nID2P has seen significant growth, increasing from \\nan\\xa0initial launch of nine pilot programmes in its \\nfirst year to more than 40\\xa0programmes in Roche \\naffiliates across the globe in\\xa02022. \\n\\nWhat has made ID2P so successful? “The people,” \\nRicky says without hesitation. “Those who lead \\nthe project in their respective countries and were \\ninvolved in the day-to-day work, who overcame \\nconstraints every step of the way. This project \\nwouldn’t be possible without their passion, initiative \\nand drive towards a single goal: addressing the \\nunmet needs of our\\xa0patients.”\\n\\nCollaboration without borders\\nThe local teams came together to design and \\ndeploy\\xa0solutions in collaboration with ecosystem \\npartners, with the power and resources of the full \\nID2P network behind them. Ricky feels fortunate \\nthat he gets to work with colleagues in almost every \\ncountry. “You have all these diverse perspectives \\nand cross-functional backgrounds at every level \\nof the project working together and trying to help \\neach other find solutions to these challenges,” \\nhe\\xa0explains. \\n\\nWhile it’s clear that Ricky is passionate about \\nmaking a difference for people and that ID2P has \\n\\nhad a significant impact on improving patients’ \\nlives,\\xa0what Ricky enjoys most about the project \\nis the relationships he’s formed. “I feel like I’ve \\ngenuinely made friends, even though I’ve met very \\nfew of them in person. I think that comes from \\ngetting to do meaningful work in a cool way with \\ndedicated people.”\\n\\nTrailblazing new paths to access\\nID2P shows no sign of slowing down, as more \\naffiliates continue joining the project and creating \\ntheir own fit-for-purpose direct-to-patient and \\nout-of-hospital solutions. In fact, Ricky is hopeful \\nthat it could serve as a future capability for \\nseveral\\xa0of Roche’s pipeline products. “I don’t \\nsee a world in which we can talk about ID2P as a \\nproject for much longer. It will just be our way of \\ndemonstrating the full value of our medicines for \\npatients and ecosystems.” \\n\\nRicky thinks Roche can play a role in helping \\necosystems adapt and establish the necessary \\ncapabilities to enhance access and firmly place \\npatients at the heart of it all. “I believe that the \\nevolution of healthcare is going to continue towards \\na much more patient-centric realm,” he says. “ID2P \\nis just the beginning, and there’s so much more we \\ncan do to trigger that transformation.”\\n\\nHaving recently relocated to Basel with his wife \\nand two young children, Ricky is excited to continue \\nplaying his part in ID2P – and is excited to meet \\nsome of the friends he’s made along the way.\\n\\n\\x0c66\\n\\nA clear commitment to innovation\\n\\nOur commitment to innovation has never been \\nclearer and in the past year we made major \\ninvestments in both research and development. \\nOur unique combination of autonomous and \\nindependent research organisations together \\nwith our investment in a strong network of more \\nthan 250 external partner organisations globally \\ndrives pioneering scientific and technological \\nbreakthroughs across healthcare.\\n\\nIn 2022, we launched Vabysmo, the first bispecific \\nantibody approved for the eye. It targets and \\ninhibits two signalling pathways linked to a \\nnumber of vision-threatening retinal conditions by \\nneutralising angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) and vascular \\nendothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A). Vabysmo \\nis approved in more than 50 countries around \\nthe world, including the United States, Japan, \\nthe United\\xa0Kingdom and the European Union for \\npeople living with neovascular or ‘wet’ age-related \\nmacular degeneration and diabetic macular \\noedema. Review by other regulatory authorities \\nis\\xa0ongoing. We continue to pioneer new ways \\nto\\xa0treat\\xa0vision-threatening eye diseases. \\n\\nThe European Commission approved a Polivy \\ncombination in previously untreated diffuse large \\nB-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and our first-in-class \\nbispecific antibody Lunsumio for the treatment \\nof relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma. \\nLunsumio represents a new type of immunotherapy \\nthat is a chemotherapy-free and fixed-duration \\ntreatment option with the potential to provide \\ndurable remissions and offer a significant period of \\ntime without treatment, following initial therapy. The \\nPolivy combination is the first treatment option in \\nmore than 20 years to show a clinically meaningful \\nimprovement in progression-free survival that is \\nnow approved in the EU for patients with previously \\nuntreated DLBCL. \\n\\nAlthough the phase III GRADUATE I and II trials \\ndid not meet their primary endpoints of slowing \\n\\nclinical decline in people with early Alzheimer’s \\ndisease, Roche remains committed to this disease, \\none of the most complex neurological disorders \\nand major public health challenges. We are \\ncontinuing to develop and deliver tests to enable \\nearly and accurate diagnosis, and have a pipeline \\nof investigational medicines for different targets, \\ntypes and stages of the disease. \\n\\nThe power of partnerships\\nFacilitating patient access to quality medicines is at \\nthe heart of our business. To meet the rising global \\ndemand for high-quality and accessible healthcare \\nservices, we have further integrated comprehensive \\nand actionable plans into our work and enhanced \\nour patient partnerships worldwide.\\n\\nIn 2022, we entered a first partnership with a \\nholistic\\xa0approach to improving population health \\nwith the International Federation of Red Cross and \\nRed Crescent Societies (IFRC). This collaboration will \\nhelp us to unlock access to previously underserved \\npopulations worldwide and will strengthen our \\ncommitment to meet the needs of patients no \\nmatter who they are\\xa0or where\\xa0they\\xa0live. \\n\\nAdvancing inclusive research\\nWe are deeply committed to addressing barriers to \\nclinical trial participation and advancing inclusive \\nresearch.

When she returned home that \\nevening, she contacted some physician friends and \\nthey recommended she consult with specialists. \\nThus began a journey she never imagined she \\nwould\\xa0face.\\n\\nAfter a number of visits to different specialists, \\nSusanne was told there was something wrong \\nwith her kidney function. A subsequent CT scan \\nrevealed a large number of swollen lymph nodes \\nwhich was suspected to be lymphoma. “I will always \\nremember the day I had that scan as it was my son’s \\n12th\\xa0birthday,” Susanne recalls. “A day that should \\nhave been about celebrating him took a turn for \\nthe worst when the urologist called me at 8.30 that \\nevening which made me very anxious. The next day, \\nmy family doctor told me I had cancer. Needless to \\nsay, I\\xa0was stunned.”\\n\\nAn elusive diagnosis\\nAfter some further testing on her lymph nodes, the \\nresults did not reveal where the cancer originated. \\n“I\\xa0asked what that meant and the oncologist said \\nI had cancer of unknown primary (CUP),” says \\nSusanne. “As soon as I got home, I started \\nresearching online like everyone does these days. \\nWhat I learned was scary – this is a type of cancer \\nwhere the original tumour cannot be found so \\ndoctors are only able to find secondary tumours \\nthat have spread as a result of the primary one.”\\n\\nAbout 3–5% of all cancer diagnoses are CUP1 and \\nthe absence of a primary tumour causes practical \\nproblems because traditional treatment approaches \\nrely on knowing the site of the cancer’s origin, for \\n\\nexample, in the lungs or breast. Therefore, most \\npatients with CUP are treated with standard \\nchemotherapy. Unfortunately, prognosis is poor \\nand\\xa0the median survival following diagnosis is \\njust\\xa06\\xa0to 12 months.2\\n\\nSusanne was concerned about next steps since \\nthere were so many unknowns. “All I could think was \\n‘how are we going to deal with this?’” Unfortunately, \\nbecause this was happening during the height \\nof the COVID-19 pandemic, Susanne was often \\nalone attending appointments at a clinic near her \\nhome. “It was hard to not have my husband there \\nwith me for support. He was only allowed to pick me \\nup afterwards,” Susanne recalls. “But on my final \\nconsultation with the doctor, he was allowed to \\nbe there with me. We asked what the options were \\nmoving forward. That moment, once again, I will \\nnever forget.”\\n\\nA path forward\\nSusanne’s doctor recommended that she move \\nher care to specialists in Heidelberg. “We \\ndrove to Heidelberg with heavy hearts, but we \\nreturned as completely different people,” she \\nsays. “We got in the car and headed home with \\nour\\xa0confidence\\xa0restored.”\\n\\nDuring her appointment, Susanne was told that \\nshe had the option of potentially receiving a \\npersonalised treatment plan by using technology \\nthat analyses the DNA of the patient’s metastases. \\nThis technology, called comprehensive genomic \\nprofiling (CGP), is a way of finding the unique \\n‘fingerprint’ of a cancer tumour and can help \\ndetermine if there are specific genomic alterations \\nthat can be targeted with molecularly guided \\ntherapy or cancer immunotherapy. The approach \\n\\n1   Understanding cancer’s secret syndrome, New Scientist\\n\\n2   Genomic Testing, Foundation Medicine, Inc. \\n\\n\\x0c76\\n\\n“That call, yet again, changed everything. \\nMy\\xa0doctor said that there are targeted \\ndrugs\\xa0to treat that specific alteration and \\nthat\\xa0we’d\\xa0be able to get it under control.”\\n\\nrepresents a shift from treating cancer based on \\nits\\xa0site, or likely site, of origin, to treating a patient, \\nlike Susanne, based on the clinically relevant \\ngenomic changes suspected in driving the cancer’s \\ngrowth. By providing a more complete picture \\nof Susanne’s cancer, CGP could help inform a \\ntailored\\xa0treatment plan and potentially remove the \\nneed to determine the cancer’s original location \\nin her body. “The team of doctors described this \\nas an opportunity and I knew I\\xa0had to seize that \\nopportunity,” recalls\\xa0Susanne. \\n\\nA personalised treatment plan\\nSusanne underwent CGP tests that evaluated \\ngenes known to be associated with cancer growth. \\nThe answers would provide essential first steps \\nin developing informed treatment strategies. In \\nAugust\\xa02020, Susanne was thrilled when she was \\ntold that her CGP revealed a genomic alteration \\nthat was driving her cancer’s growth. “That call, \\nyet again, changed everything. My CUP doctors \\nsaid that there are targeted drugs to treat that \\nspecific alteration and that we’d be able to get \\nit under control. That was the best gift anybody \\ncould\\xa0have\\xa0given me at that point,” says Susanne.\\n\\nAs soon as Susanne’s cancer alteration was \\nidentified, her personalised treatments began. \\nShe now travels to Heidelberg every four weeks \\nto receive her therapy at the clinic and is grateful \\nfor her husband’s company in the car ride each \\ntime. “The team there has been wonderful and \\n\\nvery dedicated. Plus,\\xa0my\\xa0husband and I have that \\ntime together to talk and laugh and think about \\nthe\\xa0future,” Susanne says. Throughout, Susanne \\nhas been able to continue working, and she and \\nher husband have found a new passion in mountain-\\nbiking around the scenic roads near their home. \\n“We\\xa0take a different route every day and we end up \\nin places around here that we’ve never been before. \\nIt’s just wonderful,” she says with\\xa0excitement in \\nher\\xa0voice.\\n\\nA positive outlook\\nSusanne feels incredibly lucky to have had the \\nopportunity to receive a personalised treatment \\nplan informed by CGP. The impact of CGP is \\nconstantly evolving as diagnostics tools and \\nsolutions improve, more targeted therapies \\nare developed and more data are generated to \\nimprove\\xa0our understanding of cancer biology. \\nSusanne and her husband, along with their son \\nand\\xa0daughter, are already planning holidays \\ntogether in the United States to spend time \\ntravelling and enjoying each other’s company. \\n“I’m\\xa0living my life just\\xa0like I always used to. We travel, \\nwe’re a close-knit family, and I didn’t really allow \\nanything to change in my life. There were negative \\nthings of\\xa0course having to deal\\xa0with my illness \\nbut thinking positively has always been one of my \\nbasic\\xa0principles,” says Susanne. “I’ve been given \\na gift of seeing my kids grow into adulthood, I can \\nstill spend\\xa0time with my\\xa0husband, and I can and \\nwill\\xa0continue to enjoy my\\xa0life.”\\n\\n\\x0cPersonalised healthcare \\n\\n|  Roche  77\\n\\nWhen she was first diagnosed with cancer of unknown primary, \\n\\nSusanne was unsure what the future would hold.

His interest in ocular \\nmedicine began during his medical studies in \\nAthens, Greece, and has led him to his current role \\nas a retinal specialist and principal investigator \\nfor research into artificial intelligence and digital \\ntechnologies at Moorfields Eye Hospital in \\nLondon,\\xa0United Kingdom. \\n\\nDr\\xa0Balaskas credits his keen interest in the field \\nof ophthalmology to the fact that it is constantly \\nevolving. “I’ve always liked ophthalmology \\ninstinctively. Dramatic and rapid technology \\ntransformation has revolutionised the way we \\nprovide care for patients,” he says. “Year after \\nyear,\\xa0the area is constantly reinventing itself \\nand\\xa0we are now able to treat diseases of the eye \\nthat\\xa0used\\xa0to be incurable.”\\n\\n“Our goal is to prevent vision loss, especially for \\nretinal disease,” says Dr\\xa0Balaskas. “Not so long ago, \\na diagnosis of chronic retinal disease would have \\nbeen devastating for the patient in the absence of \\neffective treatments. Most recently, we are also \\nhoping to improve the quality of life for our patients \\nusing digital technologies that may give greater \\naccess to care in the future, potentially allowing \\nthem to be monitored away from the hospital and \\ncloser to their home.”\\n\\nAn urgent need and a rapid solution \\nIn April 2020, during the early stages of the COVID-19 \\npandemic, Dr\\xa0Balaskas and his colleagues knew \\nthey needed an urgent solution. Many patients with \\nretinal disease fall into the high-risk population \\nfor developing serious illness due to COVID-19 \\nand as\\xa0such were avoiding hospital attendances. \\n\\nThis urgent need for remote vision monitoring, \\nin conjunction with regular office visits, quickly \\nresulted\\xa0in Moorfields and Roche partnering to \\npilot\\xa0a\\xa0programme to address the problem. \\n\\n“Our collaboration with Roche began out of \\nnecessity\\xa0and, within four weeks, we deployed a \\nprogramme that we are continuing to develop as \\npart\\xa0of our offering at Moorfields’ medical retina \\nclinics,” says Dr\\xa0Balaskas.\\n\\nOur proposed solution was an app called Home \\nVision Monitor that patients with chronic eye \\ndisease\\xa0could download to their smartphone or \\ntablet and monitor their vision from the comfort \\nof their own home. Patients used the app to \\nperform visual function tests and the test results \\nwere instantly\\xa0available for their clinicians to view. \\nIf\\xa0there was a change in a patient’s test results, \\ntheir\\xa0practitioners were notified and could follow \\nup\\xa0with\\xa0the patient\\xa0directly. \\n\\n“We registered approximately 500\\xa0patients into \\nthe home monitoring service with the ambition of \\nempowering them to assume greater ownership of \\nthe management of their health,” reflects Dr\\xa0Balaskas.\\n\\nChanging the landscape of care \\nWhile it could be assumed that this type of remote \\nmonitoring would create a greater distance \\nbetween clinicians and their patients, Dr\\xa0Balaskas \\nsays the opposite is true. In fact, the data generated \\nby Home Vision Monitor can help to inform and \\nenrich the discussions between the physician and \\nthe patient. “This experience has greatly impacted \\nthe\\xa0relationship I have with my patients in a positive \\nway. It has actually brought us closer and has \\ninfused a sense of reassurance that they’re being \\n\\n\\x0cPersonalised healthcare \\n\\n|  Roche  79\\n\\nDr Konstantinos Balaskas\\n\\n\\x0c80\\n\\nThanks to technological advancements in the treatment of retinal \\n\\ndiseases, it is hoped that quality of life of patients can be improved \\n\\nwith the potential of allowing them to be monitored away from \\n\\nhospital and closer to their home.\\n\\n\\x0cPersonalised healthcare \\n\\n|  Roche  81\\n\\n“We hope this programme enables us to provide \\ncare to the right patients, at the right place  \\nand at the right time.”\\n\\nmonitored regularly,” he says. Patients also still \\nmaintain their regular appointments. \\n\\nIn conjunction with regular office visits, the remote \\nmonitoring programme has the potential to reduce \\nthe\\xa0burden of hospital visits on patients and also \\non the healthcare system itself. “We hope this \\nprogramme enables us to provide care to the \\nright patients, at the right place and at the right \\ntime,” says Dr\\xa0Balaskas. “Chronic retinal disease \\nhas better\\xa0prognosis the earlier it is diagnosed \\nand treatment is started, with long-term benefits \\nfor the healthcare system and the delivery of more \\nsustainable care.” While Home Vision Monitor does \\nnot currently aid in the diagnosis of retinal disease, \\nit can help to identify changes in vision over time, \\nwhich can be\\xa0used to aid the physician’s clinical \\ndecision-making. \\n\\nLearning for the future\\nBecause this was the first initiative of its kind \\nin ophthalmology, it has attracted a significant \\namount of attention amongst the international \\nretinal community. Learnings about the barriers and \\nenablers to deploying home vision monitoring were \\nrecently published in the Journal of the American \\n\\nMedical Association. The possibility that this can \\nbe scaled has instigated discussions around the \\npotential of home vision monitoring in the future \\nand, as such, the Roche team is planning a limited \\nproduct release in the United States and expanding \\nthe pilot in the UK.\\n\\nFor Dr\\xa0Balaskas, the possibilities of this technology, \\nalong with others such as artificial intelligence, \\ndecision support systems, telemedicine and \\nvirtual clinics, really are the way of the future. \\n“My\\xa0aspiration and hope is that we will be able to \\nhave an\\xa0integrated approach to these innovative \\nsolutions because integration is key to materialising \\nthe benefits of these technologies,” he says. \\n“Putting all\\xa0of this together will enable better \\naccess\\xa0to quality care for patients in the future.”\\n\\nIn the meantime, Dr\\xa0Balaskas and the team are \\ncelebrating their recent win at the 2022 Health \\nService Journal’s Patient Safety Awards. The Home \\nVision Monitor app was awarded best Virtual or \\nRemote Care Initiative of 2022. “This was a great \\nmoment – it is a true testament to innovation, \\ncollaboration and a patient-centric approach,” \\nDr\\xa0Balaskas says proudly. \\n\\n\\x0c82\\n\\nTailoring care is personal\\n\\nToday’s convergence of pioneering science, \\nadvanced technologies, and data and analytics \\nis shifting healthcare from a one-size-fits-all \\napproach to the delivery of more patient-centred \\ncare.

All of \\nthose challenges put together mean patients are \\nexperiencing a harrowing journey.”\\n\\nAddressing a significant public health \\nchallenge\\nThanks to a partnership between Roche and the \\ngovernment of Ghana, work has begun to develop \\ninfrastructure to deliver cancer care at key \\nhospitals across the country. CCTH is one of three \\nnew treatment centres that have been opened \\n\\nacross the country through this partnership. It is \\nalready starting to address geographic access \\nbarriers to quality cancer care, support capacity \\nbuilding and training for healthcare workers, and \\nsupport awareness creation in communities around \\nthe country.\\n\\n“Before our cancer centre opened in 2021, only \\ntwo public hospitals in Ghana were mandated to \\nprovide cancer services and facilities and were \\noften overburdened, leading to delays in patient \\naccess to specialised care,” says Dr\\xa0Ngyedu. “This \\ndoes not bode well for managing outcomes and \\nworsens patients’ prognosis. The financial hardships \\npresented by long travels also worsen the plight \\nof patients. We knew it was crucial to curb these \\nchallenges by establishing this new centre to \\nservice patients within and outside the region.”\\n\\nThe centre provides not only the infrastructure and \\nspace for oncology patients to be treated, but also \\nthe treatments themselves. An oncology pharmacy \\nand ‘cold room’ were established as well to support \\nthe provision of quality medicines and reagents \\nused for diagnosis and treatment.\\n\\nA unique partnership\\nRoche has long been working to improve oncology \\ncare in Ghana, and Dr\\xa0Ngyedu is grateful for \\npartnerships like this one that directly benefits \\npatients. “Our partnership with Roche is a unique \\none. It is 100% patient-centred. It’s not about \\nproducts; it’s about supporting patient care and \\nbreaking down barriers that cancer patients face,” \\nhe says. “The private sector has a critical role to \\nplay in increasing access to care for the people of \\nGhana. We need partnerships like this to move the \\nneedle and make meaningful change.”\\n\\n1  International Agency for Research on Cancer, World Health Organization, Ghana Fact Sheet\\n\\n\\x0c90\\n\\n“Our partnership with Roche is a unique one. \\nIt is 100% patient-centred. It’s not about \\nproducts; it’s about supporting patient care \\nand breaking down barriers.”\\n\\nOne meaningful change that this partnership has \\nbrought about is the increased screening and \\ntreatment for breast cancer patients. “This year \\nfor breast cancer awareness month in October, we \\nwere able to screen over 4,000\\xa0people for breast \\ncancer. Because of the support we have received \\nfrom Roche in providing the infrastructure, we were \\nable to do this at no cost to the patients,” says \\nDr\\xa0Ngyedu. “Additionally, Roche has been working \\nwith the government to enable public funding of \\nkey\\xa0cancer treatments. This is a testament to the \\nimpact these partnerships can have.”\\n\\nA sustainable future\\nAlthough the tides are beginning to turn for patients \\nin Ghana, there are still many opportunities to \\npave the way for increased access to care in the \\nfuture. “Leveraging technology to provide care \\nfor cancer patients is critical,” reflects Dr\\xa0Ngyedu. \\n\\n“Because a large portion of the population lives \\nin remote areas, we need to find a way to provide \\ncare through\\xa0telemedicine. It is absolutely possible \\nto care for cancer patients from a distance but we \\nneed the technology in place to do so. Partnerships \\nwith the private sector have helped us get where \\nwe are today and they will continue to do so \\nin the\\xa0future as\\xa0we look to the role technology \\ncan\\xa0play.”\\n\\nRoche has made a long-term commitment to \\nGhana\\xa0and the African continent, and will continue \\nto invest in strengthening health systems and \\ncollaborating with partners to implement innovative \\nsolutions that are tailored to the specific needs of \\npatients in the region. For Dr\\xa0Ngyedu, this brings \\nhope for the future of healthcare in Ghana. “When \\nwe all have the patient at the centre of what we do, \\nwe will\\xa0always do the right thing.”\\n\\n\\x0cAccess to healthcare \\n\\n|  Roche  91\\n\\nCape Coast Teaching Hospital is home to a new cancer treatment \\n\\ncentre that has increased access to screening and treatment for \\n\\npatients in Ghana.

It was this passion that led him to \\nmedicine, and specifically gynaecologic oncology. \\n“I wanted to be a surgeon but, more than that, \\nI\\xa0wanted to see and treat each patient as a whole \\nperson.\\xa0My main goal is to help others and have \\nan\\xa0impact on\\xa0the community.”\\n\\nAn evolution towards improved prevention \\nThe cervical cancer guidelines have evolved \\nover\\xa0the years and a critical milestone was \\nachieved\\xa0in 2019. The Ministry of Health in Chile \\nintroduced a pilot project to implement HPV \\ntesting\\xa0in 14 of its 26\\xa0health services. “We have \\na good health system\\xa0but we needed to make an \\nupgrade because\\xa0the Pap test has its limitations,” \\nsays Dr\\xa0Altamirano. \\n\\nRecently Dr Altamirano has made significant \\nprogress towards this goal by playing a role \\nin changing the health system and improving \\ncervical\\xa0cancer screening in Chile.\\n\\nA long-standing process in screening\\nSince 1987, Chile has had a national cervical \\ncancer screening programme where the Pap \\ntest is used as the standard to identify women at \\nrisk. While the programme has reduced mortality \\nrates over time, women continue to be diagnosed \\nwith this preventable disease, suggesting that \\nit hasn’t been as effective with early detection \\nas it could be. “In almost 50% of cervical cancer \\ncases, women\\xa0haven’t done any kind of screening \\ntest. This\\xa0is a missed opportunity for prevention,” \\nexplains\\xa0Dr\\xa0Altamirano. \\n\\nDespite being almost 100% preventable with \\nvaccination, screening and treatment, cervical \\ncancer claims the lives of more than 34,000\\xa0women \\nevery year, making it one of the leading causes of \\ncancer deaths in women.1 Human\\xa0papillomavirus (HPV) \\nis the known cause of nearly all cases\\xa0of cervical \\ncancer, so finding and treating pre-cancerous \\ndisease before cancer develops is\\xa0an\\xa0important \\nprevention\\xa0strategy.2\\n\\nAs an advisor to the Ministry, he has been \\nadvocating for HPV testing for many years. “I’ve \\nbeen putting this forward since 2015,” he explains. \\n“I started working with my mentors on how to improve \\nthe health system because we had a shared vision \\nto help as many people as possible. The best way \\nto\\xa0do that was to change how we conduct screening \\nto\\xa0enable better prevention, so I was persistent in \\nthe need for HPV testing.” \\n\\nChile, among other countries, is moving towards \\na screening programme where HPV is the primary \\ntest for eligible women,3 in line with World Health \\nOrganization (WHO) recommendations.4 This \\nstrategy aims to better identify those who are at \\nrisk\\xa0for disease in order to prevent invasive cancer \\nfrom developing.\\n\\nOvercoming barriers to adoption \\nWhen the programme was first introduced, \\nseveral\\xa0barriers prevented some women from \\nbeing\\xa0screened. Says Dr Altamirano: “Our biggest \\nproblem is that a lot of women don’t get tested \\nbecause they think they don’t need it, don’t \\nhave time or think that it’s going to hurt, so the \\nopportunity for screening is often missed.” \\n\\n1  Cervical cancer fact sheet, World Health Organization \\n\\n|  2  Cervical cancer screening for individuals at average risk: 2020 guideline update, American \\n\\nCancer Society \\n\\n|  3  Implementación del diagnóstico molecular del VPH: experiencia chilena en curso.

He continues on his mission to raise awareness \\n\\nand education about HPV and the importance of cervical cancer \\n\\nscreening so women have the power of knowledge to take care \\n\\nof\\xa0themselves. \\n\\n\\x0cAccess to healthcare \\n\\n|  Roche  95\\n\\n“I believe I can do the best by giving people \\nthe power of knowledge to take care \\nof\\xa0themselves.”\\n\\n“We needed to increase awareness about HPV and \\nteach patients about the importance of prevention,” \\nhe says. “Education was critical not only for patients, \\nbut also for healthcare professionals because they \\nweren’t comfortable talking about HPV and were so \\naccustomed to the Pap test.” \\n\\nhave to keep screening the same women every year. \\nWe can be relatively confident that a woman with \\na negative HPV test has a low risk of developing \\ncervical cancer, so we can focus on ensuring other \\nwomen\\xa0are screened to identify those who are at \\na\\xa0higher risk.”\\n\\nIn addition to providing the HPV test to the health \\nservices in the pilot programme, Roche worked \\nwith\\xa0partners to train the primary healthcare \\nproviders who collect samples, and supported \\neducation programmes to increase awareness \\nabout HPV and the importance of screening and \\nprevention. Dr\\xa0Altamirano believes this was crucial \\nto help bring healthcare professionals on board \\nwith\\xa0the new screening method, explaining that \\n“those who went through the teaching programme \\nand learned how to perform the HPV test adapted \\nreally well to\\xa0the\\xa0change.”\\n\\nHe has also seen the impact among patients. “With \\nall the education we’re doing, women have now \\nstarted asking for the test. People are becoming \\nmore involved, seeking information and starting \\nto\\xa0know about HPV.”\\n\\nChile’s national ambition\\nToday, around 250,000 women have been screened \\nthrough the programme, and the Ministry of Health \\nplans to expand HPV testing to all health services \\nin Chile with the ultimate goal to achieve national \\naccess for all eligible women. \\n\\nDr Altamirano thinks that with HPV testing in place, \\nmore women can be reached. “The HPV test can \\nbe done every five years, which means we don’t \\n\\nHe also believes the programme is a critical \\nstep to help the country meet the WHO’s goal of \\neradicating cervical cancer within the next century. \\n“I’m a dreamer and I try to stay positive because I \\nthink it’s going to work,” he says. “As with any other \\nchange, we need time. But if we keep insisting \\nevery\\xa0day that this is the right thing to do, we can \\nachieve this goal and eliminate the disease.” \\n\\nAn ongoing thirst for knowledge\\nToday, Dr Altamirano is entrenched in the Chilean \\nhealth system. As a self-proclaimed multi-tasker, \\nhe\\xa0is a practising gynaecologic oncologist in public \\nand private healthcare, he is a member of the \\nChilean Society of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, \\nand an advisor to the Ministry of Health, recently \\nexpanding his knowledge in this area by earning \\na master’s in health administration. He is also an \\nAssistant Professor of Obstetrics and Gynaecology \\nat the University of Chile.\\n\\nBut above all, he remains committed to his goal \\nof helping others. “Through the years and with \\nmy\\xa0experience, I am most passionate about \\neducating patients and the next generation of \\ngynaecologic oncologists. I believe I can do the \\nbest\\xa0by giving people the power of knowledge \\nto\\xa0take care of themselves.” \\n\\n\\x0c96\\n\\nThe power of partnerships\\n\\nAt Roche we know that our diagnostics and \\nmedicines can only positively impact lives \\nif\\xa0they reach the people who need them. Every \\ncountry has its own unique challenges when \\nit comes to accessing healthcare, something \\nwhich\\xa0varies dramatically from country to country. \\nFunding, infrastructure, healthcare capacity and \\ndisease awareness all play a role, which is why \\nwe\\xa0firmly believe in the need to take a holistic \\nand\\xa0collaborative approach to address potential \\nbarriers. These challenges are simply too complex \\nfor any single party to solve alone.\\n\\nIncreasing access to diagnostics around \\nthe\\xa0world\\nOver the past decade our public-private \\npartnerships have strengthened laboratory \\nsystems\\xa0in African nations highly impacted by \\nHIV/AIDS, built the institutional capacity of \\nregional\\xa0and\\xa0national partners and improved \\nquality in diagnostic services across the continent. \\nTogether our efforts have improved millions of \\nlives.\\xa0For example, we have worked in partnership \\nwith the US President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS \\nRelief (PEPFAR) to scale up HIV viral load testing \\nand\\xa0early infant diagnosis. In May 2022, we \\nentered\\xa0a new partnership with the Global Fund \\nto build local capacity to tackle fundamental \\ninfrastructure challenges for\\xa0generating and \\ndelivering diagnostic\\xa0results and\\xa0managing \\nhealthcare waste.\\n\\nAddressing diabetes access barriers and \\ndisparities worldwide\\nPublic-private partnerships are critical to developing \\nsustainable access initiatives and this is something \\nthat we have seen with diabetes. Together with \\nour partners, Roche plays its part in addressing \\ndiabetes access barriers and disparities worldwide, \\nsuch as through the Changing Diabetes in Children \\nprogramme run by Roche Diabetes Care, Novo \\n\\nNordisk and other global and local partners. The \\npublic-private partnership has reached more than \\n38,000\\xa0children in over 25\\xa0countries since 2009, \\nwith Tunisia and Vietnam joining the project in 2022. \\n\\nInitiatives to increase access to medicines \\nin\\xa0low- and lower-middle-income countries\\nIn 2022, we were also delighted to renew our long-\\nstanding partnership with the World Federation of \\nHemophilia. Through this partnership more than \\n1,000\\xa0patients with haemophilia\\xa0A in low- and \\nlower-middle-income countries are being reached \\nthrough aid programmes. In addition, hundreds of \\nhealthcare professionals are being trained, and \\ntesting capacity has been enabled and expanded. \\n\\nAdditionally, we were proud to become a \\nmember of\\xa0the Access to Oncology Medicines \\n(ATOM) Coalition, a new global partnership led \\nby the Union\\xa0for International Cancer Control, \\nto increase access to quality-assured essential \\ncancer medicines in low- and lower-middle-income \\ncountries and to help countries develop the \\ncapacity for their proper use, including training \\nand diagnostics. This partnership will complement \\nour existing goal to double\\xa0the number of patients \\nreceiving our innovative therapies in low- and \\nlower-middle-income countries by the end of 2026. \\nThe goal aims to overcome the many barriers \\npatients face in low-income countries, such as \\na lack\\xa0of infrastructure as well as\\xa0economic \\npressures\\xa0and\\xa0regulatory challenges.\\n\\nThis is just a small summary of the initiatives that \\nwe are working on to expand access to healthcare \\naround the world.

Roche may have different divisions \\nand operate in different geographies, but there \\nhas always been a clear sense of a shared vision \\nand\\xa0purpose.\\n\\neffectively together, we’re going to be able to \\nbring\\xa0solutions faster to patients and customers.”\\n\\nWith that end goal in mind, the very first \\nOperating\\xa0Principle is solely about patients and \\ndoing what is best for them. “This really spotlights \\nour commitment to making patients the focal \\npoint\\xa0of everything we do,” Cris explains. \\n\\nAt the same time, the Corporate Executive \\nCommittee realised there was an important \\nopportunity to develop aligned principles that \\nreflect the unique Roche culture, while also \\nempowering the entire company to remain focused \\non innovation – and on making even more of a \\ndifference for patients and society. And this is \\nhow\\xa0the Roche Group Operating Principles were \\nborn in\\xa02022.\\n\\nA worthwhile journey\\nOur Operating Principles are eight seemingly simple \\nstatements with the goal of guiding how we work \\ntogether in different parts of the organisation. But \\nthere is a lot of meaning and thought behind each \\nindividual principle as well as the set of principles. \\nBringing this all together required input from \\ncolleagues across the organisation to ensure the \\nprinciples not only resonated with people, but also \\ninspired and challenged them to think and work in \\nnew ways.\\n\\n“It was a privilege to be a part of this process,” says \\nCris. “Our organisation has been transforming to \\nbecome more agile. Because we are now working \\ndifferently, we needed to come together around \\na single set of principles in what that looks like in \\npractice. Ultimately, if we’re able to work more \\n\\n“To have an Operating Principle that says \\n‘Put\\xa0patients first’, makes it very clear what we \\nexpect of every single person in the company,” \\nshe says. “When we keep patients top of mind, \\nit manifests in all of the things we do and we \\nfocus on understanding what they need from \\nthe\\xa0very\\xa0beginning.”\\n\\nIntegrating with the company culture\\nDuring the process of creating the principles, \\nthere\\xa0was a clear focus on ensuring they would \\nhave\\xa0a positive impact on the larger culture at \\nRoche. “We\\xa0are a ‘nice’ company,” Cris explains. \\n“And that’s important. We do incredible things \\ntogether and we really like each other. The \\nOperating Principles enable us to be supportive \\nof each other, while also feeling comfortable \\nbringing different views to debate. And that \\nfosters\\xa0innovation much more\\xa0quickly.”\\n\\nCris adds: “They also help us hold each other \\naccountable and become better teammates, \\ncolleagues and partners. If you enable people \\nto bring their full selves to the conversation and \\nto\\xa0be celebrated for that, and you make it okay \\nto both agree and disagree with colleagues, you \\nare\\xa0truly embracing each other’s differences. \\nThat\\xa0is\\xa0an\\xa0integral part of our culture.”\\n\\n\\x0c104\\n\\n“When we keep patients top of mind, it \\nmanifests in all of the things we do and we \\nfocus on understanding what they need \\nfrom\\xa0the very beginning.”\\n\\nAligning with our future ambitions\\nRoche’s long-term ambitions drive its work each \\nand every day. The Operating Principles serve \\nas a\\xa0critical tool to make those goals a reality \\nand help\\xa0different parts of the organisation work \\ntogether more effectively to make a bigger and \\nmore sustainable impact. “The principles help us \\nbecome an even more innovative, collaborative \\ncompany without losing sight of our biggest goals,” \\nCris says. \\n\\nThe principles were put in place with longevity \\nin mind. “You don’t want the way you work to be \\nconstantly changing,” says Cris.

It may even be \\nable\\xa0to help us greatly reduce the time and costs \\nneeded to develop new drugs.” \\n\\nIn the months following the roll-out of the Operating \\nPrinciples, it was clear that people were beginning \\nto live them.

Our new \\n\\nOperating\\xa0Principles unite our employees in how we work \\n\\ntogether\\xa0to\\xa0achieve this goal while embracing the uniqueness \\n\\nof\\xa0each individual. \\n\\n\\x0c106\\n\\nA leader as unique as the patients she serves\\n\\nSpend just a few minutes with Lorice Scalise, \\nGeneral Manager of Roche Pharmaceuticals \\nArgentina, and\\xa0you will immediately sense her \\npassion for people. That passion is part of what \\nmakes Lorice an exceptional leader and an effective \\nadvocate for\\xa0improving access to healthcare. \\nLorice understands that success in expanding \\naccess begins with understanding and valuing \\nthe diversity of individuals, and also requires \\nthat\\xa0Roche\\xa0leadership reflects that diversity.\\n\\nAcross more than 20 years at Roche, Lorice \\nhas witnessed a substantial increase in the \\ncompany’s commitment to building a diverse \\nand inclusive leadership culture. She has also \\nseen how that commitment can better equip the \\ncompany to\\xa0meet\\xa0the diverse needs of a vast \\nworld\\xa0of\\xa0patients.\\n\\nThis evolution has impacted Lorice’s own leadership \\nstyle. “When Roche decided to focus on being \\nmore\\xa0diverse and inclusive, we were empowered \\nto bring our true selves to work. That changed the \\nway those of us in leadership positions viewed our \\nmissions at work and how we lived each day.”\\n\\nAn initial hesitancy\\nIn 2008, when Roche first announced commitments \\nto increase the number of women in leadership, \\nLorice was shocked. As she emphatically explains, \\n“I didn’t want to be part of a quota. I wanted to be \\nvalued for my achievements, not my gender!”\\n\\nAs those initial efforts were being put in place, \\nRoche CEO Severin Schwan visited Brazil and \\nLorice shared her concerns. “Severin said that he \\nunderstood my feelings, but that we needed to \\nmake this change so the company could begin to \\n\\novercome all biases. He explained that if we are \\nable to do that, then we can really see everyone’s \\nachievements clearly.” For Lorice, that conversation \\nwas a turning point.\\n\\nThe new focus on diversity and inclusion enabled \\nLorice to stop putting energy into being the \\nperson\\xa0she thought others expected her to be, \\nand\\xa0to become comfortable simply being herself. \\nThat new-found freedom made her more effective \\nin her job. She explains further, “I realised I can \\ntrust myself and connect with my emotions and \\nintuition at work. When I did that, I saw how much \\nof my potential I had been blocking, and took steps \\nto\\xa0remove obstacles I\\xa0had put in my own way.”\\n\\nSince then, the company’s approach to diversity \\nand\\xa0inclusion has evolved significantly. “Today, \\nwe talk about it at a new level,” Lorice says. \\n“We\\xa0know that if we don’t consider the different \\nperspectives\\xa0of the people involved in our work, \\nincluding cultural,\\xa0economic and religious aspects, \\nwe cannot effectively serve our purpose of helping \\nall\\xa0patients.”\\n\\nAn important seat at the table\\nLorice has a genuine passion for listening and \\nis truly interested in what others have to say – \\nqualities\\xa0that are critical as a member of the \\nRoche Diversity and Inclusion (D&I) Council. “Being \\npart of the D&I Council is a great achievement,” \\nshe explains. “Not\\xa0just for me, but for the Latin \\nAmerican\\xa0region, and all under-represented \\npeople,\\xa0really.”\\n\\nIn 2022, the D&I Council focused on a range of \\ninitiatives, including increasing the talent pipeline \\nin under-represented countries, making clinical \\n\\n\\x0cPeople and\\xa0culture \\n\\n|  Roche  107\\n\\nLorice Scalise\\n\\n\\x0c108\\n\\nAs a leader, Lorice understands that increasing access to \\n\\nhealthcare begins with understanding and valuing the diversity \\n\\nof\\xa0individuals, and also requires that Roche leadership and \\n\\nworkforce reflect that\\xa0diversity.\\n\\n\\x0cPeople and\\xa0culture \\n\\n|  Roche  109\\n\\n“It’s not enough to have the latest innovations \\nand regulatory approvals.

She \\ncautions against a belief that, because the goals \\nand declarations are in place, the company has \\ndone all of the necessary groundwork or knows \\neverything about the subject. “This is a situation \\nthat is always changing. There are always new \\nthings\\xa0to learn and understand,” Lorice explains.\\n\\nFinally, Lorice seeks to dispel the belief that \\ndiversity and inclusion are simply two different \\nwords for the same thing. She explains the \\ndistinction: “You can have a diverse group of \\npeople,\\xa0from various places, cultures and with \\ndifferent beliefs. But if you don’t value and accept \\ntheir ideas, or if you discount what they say because \\nthey don’t speak perfect English, for example, or \\nyou have other biases, you are not being inclusive. \\nDiversity is the first step and inclusion is the vital \\nsecond step.”\\n\\nConnecting access and diversity\\nLorice firmly believes that science and innovation \\ncan only achieve their purpose if they reach \\neveryone. “It’s not enough to have the latest \\ninnovations and regulatory approvals,” she explains. \\n“We have to remove all the barriers – including social, \\ncultural, economic and more.”\\n\\nScreening for HPV, the virus that can cause \\ncervical\\xa0cancer, is a clear example. “We know \\nthat, for many reasons, women in many places \\nare unable\\xa0or unwilling to see a physician,” Lorice \\nsays. “So we determined that to help protect \\nmore\\xa0women from cancer, we needed to develop \\na self-administered HPV test. We have to pay \\nattention to the unique aspects of the cultures we \\nserve. Only then can we understand the specific \\ntypes of innovations that are needed.” Lorice \\nbelieves that Roche has a responsibility to lead the \\nmission to expand healthcare access to people in \\nall parts of the world, with the understanding that \\nthey have different needs, biologies, cultures and \\nreactions to\\xa0treatments.\\n\\nLeading by example\\nLorice’s commitment to improving diversity and \\ninclusion at Roche is deeply rooted in her own \\npersonal beliefs. “I walk the walk,” she explains. \\n“I’m\\xa0a single mom of two boys and a girI, I took my \\nfirst English class at age\\xa035, I asked for feedback \\nand worked hard on my own development with \\nthe help of my mentors. I am living proof you can \\nalways\\xa0overcome barriers.”\\n\\nLorice is equally passionate about life outside of \\nthe office. “I wake up every morning excited for \\nwhat the day will bring,” she says. “My family and \\nfriends ground me and give me confidence. I can \\nfight any battle if they are cheering for me.” When \\nshe’s not leading the charge for a more diverse \\nand inclusive workforce at the office, you can \\nfind her on an adventure with her three kids, or \\nlost in a book, exploring yet another new world \\nof\\xa0unique\\xa0individuals.\\n\\n\\x0c110\\n\\nSupporting and engaging our people\\n\\nThe year 2022 left its mark in multiple ways. \\nFinally,\\xa0we had overcome the pandemic and moved \\nto a more endemic state. This allowed us to start \\nreturning to and spending more time in the office \\nwherever possible. At the same time, new challenges \\nwere revealed in the form of political tensions and \\nconflicts in different parts of the world, as well as \\ninflation and a potential energy shortage in Europe. \\n\\nSince 2010, we have run our bi-yearly Global \\nEmployee Opinion Survey (GEOS) measuring\\xa0how \\nengaged and happy our employees are at work. After \\nthe last cycle in 2021, we continued to check in with \\nour workforce to sense if our engagement efforts \\nare moving in the right direction. During 2022, \\napproximately 20 small and large affiliates across \\nRoche conducted regular GEOS Pulse Surveys. We \\nwere pleased to see that our continued engagement \\nactivities are paying off and that our people are \\nhappy working at Roche, despite the many challenges \\nthey have faced over the last several years.\\n\\nIn 2022, we carried out a living-wage analysis in \\n63 of the countries where Roche operates. The \\nanalysis showed that in all countries Roche pays \\nits\\xa0employees above the living wage. We will \\ncontinue to regularly monitor this in the future.\\n\\nOur ongoing focus on the safety and well-being \\nof our people\\nWhile our purpose is centred on serving patients \\nand society, as an employer we care about our \\npeople and their safety and well-being – especially \\nin times of escalating political threats and conflicts. \\nTherefore, we have put employee assistance \\nprogrammes in place with a special focus on \\nmanaging mental stress and health, and offered \\nfinancial support to employees in conflict\\xa0regions.\\n\\nOur global Live Well team knows more than ever \\nthat it’s\\xa0important to take care of ourselves \\nso we can care for others. In 2022, the global \\nLive Well programme focused on mental health \\nas the guiding theme. Throughout the year, \\ndedicated Well-Being Days were offered covering \\ndifferent aspects of mental health including \\n‘Boost your energy’, ‘Mindfulness and resilience’, \\n‘Mental\\xa0health\\xa0awareness and neurodiversity’ \\nand\\xa0‘Gratefulness’.\\n\\nLeading and learning \\nOur networked ways of working require everyone \\nto\\xa0build the capability to lead and learn. This \\nincludes first and foremost self-leadership and a \\nlearning mindset. During 2022, Roche employees \\nglobally completed 3,430,401\\xa0hours of learning and \\ntraining\\xa0through our internal learning platform. \\n\\nIn addition, this implies a safe environment and a \\nculture based on a shared set of values, leadership \\ncommitments and a collaboration framework \\nthat all underpin our purpose. In February 2022, \\nwe launched our new global set of Operating \\nPrinciples, which define how we work together to \\nachieve our long-term ambitions. This single set \\nof principles, which was extremely well received \\nby our\\xa0employees, replaced all divisional and \\nfunctional\\xa0principles previously developed. \\n\\nDuring 2022, we continued to support our \\nleaders\\xa0and employees to enhance and advance \\ntheir leadership skills through our various \\ndedicated\\xa0leadership programmes.

Thirty years later, \\n\\nthis passion fuels his work in developing Roche’s \\n\\nclimate\\xa0change mitigation strategy. \\n\\n\\x0cEnvironment \\n\\n|  Roche  117\\n\\nNerina  \\nItin\\n\\nEnvironmental Specialist \\n\\nRotkreuz, Switzerland\\n\\nNerina’s work allows her not only to contribute to the \\n\\ndevelopment of local environmental strategies but also \\n\\nto\\xa0engage with her colleagues about how they can \\n\\ncontribute individually to the site’s environmental goals. \\n\\n\\x0c118\\n\\nThomas Wolf\\n\\n\\x0cEnvironment \\n\\n|  Roche  119\\n\\nSteering towards a sustainable energy future\\n\\nGrowing up in a small town in the rural Nahe valley \\nin West Germany, Thomas Wolf spent much of his \\nchildhood outdoors exploring nature. The area is \\nhome to vast rolling hills, forests and vineyards, \\nall of which were the backdrop for many of his \\nadventures as a young boy. “I had a very typical \\nchildhood experience of going to school, playing \\nsports with friends and spending much of my spare \\ntime outdoors,” he explains. “This really was the \\nbeginning of my love of nature and my passion for \\nenvironmental protection.”\\n\\nAlong with this childhood passion for the outdoors, \\nThomas credits his chemistry teacher as being a \\ndriving force behind his other interests — science \\nand engineering. After learning that there were \\nmany good career prospects in this area, he \\nattended the University of Karlsruhe (today the \\nKarlsruhe Institute of Technology) and graduated \\nwith a degree in chemical engineering. It was not \\nlong after he graduated that Thomas’s career at \\nRoche began in the global engineering department \\nof our former Vitamins Division – and now, more \\nthan\\xa030 years later, he is putting these passions \\nto good use in his role as Chief Environmental \\nSustainability Officer. “I’m very fortunate to have \\na career where I can help fight climate change. For \\nshaping Roche’s climate change mitigation strategy, \\nmy technical background is definitely a huge asset \\nin the work we’re doing here,” says Thomas.\\n\\nTowards a sustainable energy future\\nOur environmental goal is ambitious – reduce \\ngreenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to zero by \\n2050. Like any company, Roche requires energy \\nto operate. In order to address energy-related \\n\\nissues and climate change, we have been working \\ntowards a sustainable energy future for many years. \\n“Delaying or waiting for others to find meaningful \\nsolutions could result in more dramatic, more \\ndisruptive, more expensive changes in the future,” \\nThomas explains. “I am proud that Roche did not \\ndelay taking action in the past and because of that, \\nwe are well on our way to achieving this goal.”\\n\\nFrom 2004 to 2022, we have implemented carbon \\ndioxide reduction measures that have led to a \\n64%\\xa0decrease in carbon dioxide generated within \\nour operations, while world emissions rose by 31% \\nduring the same period. Our goal is to achieve \\na reduction of 82% by 2025 and 92% by 2029 \\ncompared to 2004. When asked how we have been \\nable to achieve these targets and how we will \\ncontinue to ensure we are moving towards them, \\nThomas’s answer is a simple one – with a clear and \\nwell thought-out strategy together with enthusiastic \\nand engaged teams that develop and implement \\nplans to make it\\xa0happen.\\n\\nIt takes a village\\n“In order to develop and implement a strategy \\nthat will result in meaningful change, we must \\ncollaborate with our internal as well as external \\nstakeholders and partners,” says Thomas. Through \\nknowledge sharing, the impact of our efforts is \\namplified across our network of Group functions \\nand local sites. Our Global Energy Summit, which \\nhas taken place annually for the past 16\\xa0years, \\nhas been a critical element in fostering a close \\ncommunity of subject matter experts who share a \\npassion for meeting Roche’s environmental goals \\nin\\xa0a conscientious and sustainable way.\\n\\n\\x0c120\\n\\n“Each site has different considerations, \\ncapabilities and priorities, so we must \\nmaintain open lines of communication \\nand\\xa0collaboration along the way.”\\n\\nWith more than 150 Roche sites around the world, \\nworking closely as a community is imperative, \\nespecially because not all sites are focused on the \\nsame things. Although we have developed a global \\nstrategy and overarching targets that we are moving \\ntowards, our sites must develop their own roadmaps \\ntowards a sustainable energy future. “Each site has \\ndifferent considerations, capabilities and priorities, \\nso we must maintain open lines of communication \\nand collaboration along the way,” says Thomas. \\n“While optimising vehicle fleet performance may be \\nmost important to one site, for example, optimising \\nenergy use in manufacturing may be more important \\nand feasible to another.”\\n\\nThe future is sustainable\\nAccording to Thomas, the future can indeed be a \\nbright one. Our organisation has worked tirelessly \\nover the past two decades to establish the \\ngovernance and strategy for our environmental \\ninitiatives, stipulate guidelines and directives, \\nset ambitious targets, implement monitoring \\nmechanisms and put together teams of passionate \\npeople who are all dedicated to making an impact.\\n\\n“Goals without a plan are just a wish,” says \\nThomas. “Meeting our long-term zero-emission \\n\\ngoal\\xa0requires\\xa0diligent planning today. If we keep \\nup\\xa0this momentum, we will continue to see the \\ntangible results of our efforts.”\\n\\n“We all have a duty to contribute to the work we \\nare doing in this area. As long as we have a great \\ncommunity of enthusiastic experts who are actively \\ncontributing and the support of our leadership to \\ndo\\xa0so, we will make our mark,” he says.\\n\\nWhen asked what is the one thing each of us can \\ndo collectively to make a difference, Thomas has \\na swift and clear answer – mindful consumption. \\n“Whether it’s reducing the consumption of \\nmaterials\\xa0and resources like energy and water, or \\nreusing or recycling materials, all of these things \\nhave a positive impact along the entire value \\nchain. We are already experiencing the dramatic \\nconsequences of climate change and realise that \\nclimate change is one of the biggest risks for our \\nplanet. The consequences of failing to mitigate \\nwill be enormous\\xa0for our social, environmental \\nand financial systems. If we all appreciate the \\nrole we play in this\\xa0and the\\xa0actions we can take \\nto help mitigate it,\\xa0we will see a\\xa0better future for \\ngenerations to\\xa0come.”\\n\\n\\x0cEnvironment \\n\\n|  Roche  121\\n\\nThomas’s passion for sustainability has been the driving force \\n\\nbehind his 30-year tenure at Roche. He helps ensure that our \\n\\nclimate\\xa0mitigation strategy is driving us towards our goal of \\n\\nreducing our greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050. \\n\\n\\x0c122\\n\\nEnvironmental protection – challenging \\nbut\\xa0achievable\\n\\nAfter completing their bachelor’s degrees in \\nenvironmental engineering in 2018, many of Nerina \\nItin’s classmates went on to pursue careers working \\nfor non-governmental organisations. Although \\nthis seemed like a logical choice given the many \\nenvironmental groups active around the world, \\nNerina took a different approach. “For me, I felt \\nI could contribute more to a company where \\nthe environment is not the main business. I was \\nimpressed with the work Roche was already doing \\nin the area of environmental protection and felt \\nthat\\xa0I could put my knowledge and skills to good \\nuse. It was an easy decision for me, so I applied \\nfor an internship and was thrilled to be offered the \\nrole,”\\xa0says Nerina.\\n\\nMaking an impact\\nOver the past four years, Nerina has indeed been \\nmaking an impact by developing and implementing \\nvarious programmes as an Environmental Specialist \\nat\\xa0our Diagnostics site in Rotkreuz, Switzerland. \\nThe\\xa0site is home to our central Diagnostics customer \\nareas and functions including research and \\ndevelopment, production and logistics. Nerina’s \\nwork allows her not only to contribute to the \\ndevelopment of local environmental strategies \\nand roadmaps but also to engage with Rotkreuz \\nemployees about how they can contribute \\nindividually to the site’s environmental goals. \\n\\n“It’s not only one person or one department \\nthat makes a difference. Site services lay the \\ngroundwork but everyone is empowered and \\nencouraged to take action and that really is one \\nof\\xa0our main strategies – implement sustainability \\nin\\xa0everything we do,” Nerina explains. “We have \\n\\nclear and measurable goals, but sometimes \\nthere\\xa0are no\\xa0technical measures that can be put \\nin place, so\\xa0by engaging\\xa0our employees in other \\nareas, such\\xa0as reducing business flights, we can \\nall\\xa0make\\xa0a\\xa0difference.”\\n\\nAmbitious goals\\nThe specific goals and roadmap that the team \\nat Rotkreuz has developed are indeed ambitious. \\nOne\\xa0that stands out in particular is the reduction \\nof\\xa0fossil fuels for heating and warm water to\\xa0zero  \\nby 2030. “Yes, this is a very ambitious goal, \\nbut it’s definitely achievable,” explains Nerina. \\n“We\\xa0have already been able to ensure that \\n100% of our\\xa0electricity comes from sustainable \\nsources\\xa0–\\xa0so\\xa0why not reach even higher?” \\n\\nAnother area of focus at the site is business flight \\nreduction and the promotion of alternative forms \\nof collaboration and transportation. With around \\n3,000\\xa0employees at the site, their contribution is a \\nclear and impactful way to help achieve the goals \\nNerina and her team are driving towards. “It all adds \\nup no matter how small it may seem,” says Nerina. \\n“That’s why employee engagement is so important \\nto us. We know the impact we can make when we \\nall\\xa0contribute.”\\n\\nCollaborating with other sites and with the global \\nSafety, Security, Health and Environment Protection \\nteam is also an instrumental component of Nerina’s \\nwork. By sharing\\xa0knowledge and best practices, the \\nentire community can learn from and challenge \\neach other\\xa0to work in new ways and try new things, \\nall\\xa0with the goal of incremental improvements \\nyear\\xa0over\\xa0year.\\n\\n\\x0cEnvironment \\n\\n|  Roche  123\\n\\nNerina Itin\\n\\n\\x0c124\\n\\nAt our Diagnostics site in Rotkreuz, Nerina helps engage employees \\n\\non how they can help us achieve our sustainability goals.

Roche has achieved a lot and we need to \\nkeep\\xa0going!”\\n\\nAs for her own future, Nerina is following her \\npassion\\xa0and continuing to study in this area. She \\nis currently working towards a master’s degree \\nin environment and natural resources and hopes \\nthat by further developing her knowledge and \\nskills, it will be valuable to her work at Roche. \\nWhen\\xa0asked\\xa0where this lifelong passion and \\n\\ncommitment came from, she doesn’t hesitate \\nto\\xa0explain:\\n\\n“My mother was an environmental teacher so \\nwhen I was growing up she greatly influenced \\nmy interest\\xa0in\\xa0this area. I also spent much of my \\nchildhood involved in the Scouts, so my love for \\nnature and the outdoors was almost destined \\nfrom\\xa0the\\xa0beginning.”\\n\\nNerina looks forward to the challenging work \\nahead,\\xa0both in her studies and her work at Roche. \\n“So far I enjoy working in this field and as long as I \\nfeel I am still contributing, I will do so for as long as \\nI\\xa0possibly can. I’m constantly learning and looking \\nfor solutions to complex problems. It will take \\nmindset and behavioural changes for society to \\nbring about meaningful change. If I can play a role \\nin that, big or small, this is what I will continue to \\ndo\\xa0long into the future.”\\n\\n\\x0c126\\n\\nEmbracing our environmental \\nresponsibilities \\n\\nEnvironmental protection is an intrinsic part of \\nRoche’s business. We approach it with the same \\nsense of responsibility, and just as methodically, as \\nwe approach issues concerning quality, productivity \\nand cost-efficiency. We continuously monitor our \\nenvironmental performance, and aim to collect data \\non at least 95% of each key performance indicator. \\nBy doing so, we ensure compliance with our high \\nstandards and objectives, and guarantee that our \\nprocesses and equipment are state of the art.\\n\\nEnvironmental risks are mitigated via a system of \\nprevention and a successful environmental risk \\nmanagement system. The company’s environmental \\nprogramme has operational strategies covering \\nclimate change mitigation, reducing emissions and \\nincreasing resource efficiency, the environmental \\naspects of procurement, and water and waste \\nmanagement. We complement the strategies by \\nsetting tangible and quantitative medium-term \\n(2025) and long-term (2050) goals. \\n\\nEco-balance\\nRoche measures its environmental impact using \\nthe eco-balance metric, for which we have \\nestablished a Group-wide goal (36% reduction from \\n2019 levels by 2025). Eco-balance refers to the \\nconsumption of energy and resources, and to the \\nemissions and waste from our business activities. \\nIt describes the total environmental impact of our \\noperations. By allocating environmental impact \\npoints to ecologically relevant parameters, such \\nas the consumption of natural resources and the \\nemissions to air, water and soil, we obtain a view \\nof the environmental pressure we place on the \\nearth’s ecosystems. These points are added up \\nand then related to the total number of employees, \\nwhich enables us to monitor our ecological impact \\nper\\xa0employee.\\n\\nOur total environmental impact per employee \\ndecreased by approximately 3.2% in 2022. Our \\ncontinued reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) \\nemissions and a decrease in the amount of waste \\nhad a\\xa0positive effect on our environmental impact.\\n\\nA responsible approach to energy usage\\nUsing natural resources in a sustainable manner is \\nfundamental to Roche’s environmental strategy. A \\nlarge proportion of the energy we use still comes \\nfrom fossil fuels. As a result, we produce GHG, \\nmainly carbon dioxide, and other waste products \\nthat contribute to climate change and air pollution. \\nMinimising our negative impact involves actively \\ncontributing to a sustainable energy future. This \\nincludes reducing energy consumption, increasing \\nefficiency, implementing innovative technologies \\nand increasing the use of sustainable energy. In \\n2022, our scope\\xa01 and\\xa02 energy consumption per \\nemployee decreased by 0.8%. This\\xa0reduction was \\nachieved by implementing energy-saving measures \\nand reducing the amount of\\xa0fuel we use to heat, \\ncool and operate our sites.\\n\\nGreenhouse gas emissions and climate change\\nEnvironmental sustainability and climate change \\nmitigation go hand in hand and both are critical \\nglobal issues.

We saw the opportunity to make a real and \\nlong-lasting impact.”\\n\\nLucia Erniawati, the Chapter Lead for Access, \\nCommunications and Health System Value Strategy \\nat Roche Indonesia, is talking about the importance \\nof identifying a bold vision to unite partners with \\ndifferent goals and perspectives.\\n\\nIn a country like Indonesia – which has hugely \\ncomplex health infrastructure needs to support \\n274\\xa0million people across 17,000\\xa0islands, spanning \\nthree time zones – the potential impact of bold \\npartnerships can be significant.\\n\\nTake an ongoing project to train specialist oncology \\nnurses, for example.\\n\\nCancer survival rates in Indonesia are significantly \\nlower than those in developed countries due to \\nlow awareness, poor diagnostic capabilities and \\nlack of specialised care facilities. When exploring \\nthe pain points along the patient continuum of \\ncare, Lucia and her team realised that the scale of \\nthese problems are compounded by the absence \\nof\\xa0specialised nurses who provide care to patients \\nwith cancer.\\n\\n“Oncology nurses play such an important role in \\nhelping patients throughout their entire journey, \\nbut our research suggested that the majority of \\nnurses learn to deal with the complexities of cancer \\ntreatment and palliative care on the job,” she says. \\n“In addition, due to competing healthcare priorities, \\nthey are often rotated from one position to \\n\\nThe nursing workforce is also challenged by the \\nimbalanced distribution across regions, meaning \\nmany regions of the country are underserved\\xa0by \\nhealthcare professionals. And there was a significant \\nlack of nurses with specific oncology expertise.\\n\\nLucia and her team saw the potential of a \\nspecial\\xa0focus on cancer care nursing and decided \\nto\\xa0catalyse the launch of the first specialised \\noncology training for nurses in Indonesia.\\n\\nPartnerships mean progress\\nWith the bold vision in place, the team needed to \\ngain buy-in from other stakeholders. These included \\nthe Indonesian Ministry of Health, Indonesia \\nUniversity, the Dharmais National Cancer Center, \\nand the Oncology Nursing Association.\\n\\nAlthough each partner had its own perspectives \\nand goals, all agreed that the potential benefit of \\ntraining oncology nurses could be significant, and \\ntogether began working to implement a plan. At its \\ncore is a scholarship programme – supported by \\nthe Roche Corporate Donations and Philanthropy \\nEmerging Market Scholarships Programme – to train \\noncology nurses at Indonesia University and help \\ndevelop country-specific cancer care.\\n\\nThe progress has already been significant. In 2022, \\nthe basic oncology nursing training curriculum was \\naccredited by the Ministry of Health, 30 programme \\ntrainers were certified, 50 nurses were certified in \\nbasic oncology nursing training and 31 students \\n\\n\\x0c136\\n\\n“That’s when corporate donations and \\nphilanthropy work best – not just as a    \\nstand-alone grant, but as a starting point; \\na\\xa0catalyst to real, meaningful change.”\\n\\nwere enrolled in the three-year oncology nurse \\nspecialist training programme.\\n\\nFuture goals include placing an oncology nurse \\nspecialist in every one of the archipelago’s \\n38\\xa0provinces, opening five new training centres \\nand\\xa0establishing oncology nurse specialist \\nprogrammes at more universities. And the \\nmomentum is really starting to build.\\n\\n“The significance of this initiative is that our partners \\nhave fully invested in the vision of oncology nurses \\nas a long-term solution, and now they are spreading \\nthe word and the project is growing and almost \\ntaking on a life of its own,” says Lucia. “It’s not just \\nas a stand-alone grant, but as a starting point; \\na\\xa0catalyst to real, meaningful change.”\\n\\nA personal passion\\nIn her 27 years at Roche, Lucia is proud to have \\nbeen involved in several catalysts for change \\nthroughout Indonesia. These include an effort \\nto rebuild healthcare centres after a large \\nearthquake in 2018, and a programme to reduce \\nthe percentage\\xa0of children affected by childhood \\nstunting (a significant issue in Indonesia and many \\nlow- and lower-middle-income countries) from \\n38% to 14% by 2024. Lucia highlights how the \\nlatter programme is another great example of \\nhow\\xa0projects can quickly build in momentum.\\n\\nThese programmes were also supported by our \\nglobal Corporate Donations and Philanthropy team. \\nUltimately, the goal is always that the donation, \\nthrough partnership and collaboration, becomes \\nself-sustaining. It’s one of the core values when \\nit\\xa0comes to Roche philanthropic initiatives. \\n\\n“We established a centre of excellence in one \\nof the worst affected areas for stunting in the \\ncountry, but that also served as a proof of concept \\nfor other\\xa0regions,” she says. “Another regional \\ngovernment quickly committed to adopting the \\nproject in their area because they could clearly \\nsee\\xa0the benefit of the programme. Again, we \\nwere able to act as an instigator, catalyst and \\nongoing partner. We established the centre, \\nbut then linked\\xa0them with key policymaker and \\npotential partners so that access to care could \\ngrow throughout the country and the centre could \\nensure\\xa0its own ongoing long-term sustainability.”\\n\\nLucia’s passion to make an impact extends to \\nfundraising activities, including cooking to \\nraise funds for the annual Roche Children’s \\nWalk, the company’s largest employee-driven \\nphilanthropic\\xa0event.\\n\\n“Whether at work or at home, I just want to make a \\ndifference,” she says. “And when like-minded people \\ncome together, we can achieve amazing things.”\\n\\n\\x0cCommunity engagement \\n\\n|  Roche  137\\n\\nLucia has always been passionate about uniting our partners \\n\\naround a meaningful goal. From helping to establish an oncology \\n\\nnursing scholarship in Indonesia to helping to set up a centre \\n\\nof excellence to reduce childhood stunting, Lucia knows that \\n\\ncollaborating with others can truly make a difference.\\n\\n\\x0c138\\n\\nBringing specialised oncology nursing home\\n\\nMargareth Lasut was, quite literally, born into the \\nmedical profession. Throughout her childhood in \\nIndonesia’s North Sulawesi province, she saw her \\nmother, a dedicated nurse, make a difference in \\nthe lives of countless patients. Even as a young \\ngirl, Margareth knew she wanted to follow in \\nthose\\xa0footsteps. \\n\\nWhat she didn’t know in those early days was how \\nlarge and important the impact she could have on \\nher community could really be.\\n\\nThe journey begins\\nMargareth applied to the programme and was \\nquickly accepted. She and her fellow scholarship \\nrecipients travelled from around the country to \\nJakarta to begin their studies in September 2022. \\n\\n“The programme is very interactive and interesting,” \\nshe says. “There are no limits for us to express \\nourselves and learn how to impact as many people \\nas possible by continually working to improve our \\nknowledge and skills.”\\n\\nSeeing a need, seeking a solution\\nMargareth became a registered nurse in 2018 and \\nquickly realised she wanted to do more to help \\npatients access the highest levels of care. She was \\nwell aware that care for cancer patients in North \\nSulawesi needed improvement. The hospital in which \\nMargareth worked, the largest in the region, was in \\nthe early stages of developing its first cancer unit. \\n\\nIn early 2022, Margareth’s supervisor told her \\nabout\\xa0a first-of-its-kind programme to provide \\nscholarships in specialised oncology nursing. \\nShe\\xa0learned that the programme, which was \\ndeveloped by the University of Indonesia and \\nsupported by Roche, was accepting applications. \\nMargareth immediately knew she had found a way \\nto improve the quality of care for the people in \\nher\\xa0community. \\n\\n“For me, this programme was an answered prayer,” \\nMargareth explains. “It gave me the opportunity \\nto expand my nursing knowledge at one of the \\nbest educational institutions in Indonesia. And I \\ncan bring that knowledge back to my colleagues \\nand ultimately help patients, their families and \\nmy\\xa0entire\\xa0community.”\\n\\nOf the many new concepts Margareth has been \\nstudying, she cites the ‘care continuum’ as one of \\nthe most interesting and helpful. “I’ve learned that, \\nas a cancer nurse, we don’t just treat a patient once \\nthey’ve arrived at the hospital after a diagnosis,” \\nshe explains. “We have to start even before the \\ncancer treatments begin (through prevention and \\ndetection) and provide specialised care all the way \\nthrough the rehabilitation stage, or the end-of-life \\nexperience, if that is the outcome.” \\n\\n“Another aspect that I love about this programme \\nis that I have the opportunity to visit hospitals in \\nJakarta and see with my own eyes what advanced \\ncancer care looks like. There is so much I can do \\nto\\xa0improve care back home,” she says. \\n\\nBringing the benefits home\\nWhen Margareth returns to North Sulawesi after \\nher training is complete, she will be among the \\nfirst oncology nursing specialists in the province, \\nwhich has a population of 2.5\\xa0million people. \\nShe is already\\xa0looking forward to the difference \\nher new expertise can make for cancer patients. \\nShe explains: “Every year, the number of cancer \\npatients\\xa0in our region is increasing. I hope to be \\n\\n\\x0cCommunity engagement \\n\\n|  Roche  139\\n\\nMargareth Lasut\\n\\n\\x0c140\\n\\nAs one of the first students enrolled in the oncology nurse specialist \\n\\ntraining programme, Margareth knows she plays a role in helping \\n\\neducate other nurses on how to care for those living with cancer. \\n\\nShe believes that education is a key component in helping alleviate \\n\\nan overburdened healthcare system in Indonesia.\\n\\n\\x0cCommunity engagement \\n\\n|  Roche  141\\n\\n“At first, I thought my patients would learn \\nfrom me. But then I realised that I was the \\none\\xa0who would be learning from them.”\\n\\nable\\xa0to give as many of them as I can access to \\nquality care.”\\n\\n“Also, I want to share my new knowledge with \\nother nurses and encourage them to continue \\ntheir education as well, so cancer treatment in \\nNorth Sulawesi can continue to improve, far into \\nthe\\xa0future.”\\n\\nIncreasing the number of oncology nursing \\nspecialists throughout Indonesia will hopefully \\nhelp to alleviate an overburdened state healthcare \\nsystem. As Margareth explains, “We know that \\nadding even one oncology nursing specialist to a \\nhospital staff can lower the overall cost of treating \\ncancer patients. And that nurse can help to educate \\ncolleagues, which in turn can increase access to \\ncare for more patients.” \\n\\nShe believes the scholarship programme, combined \\nwith an understanding of the many benefits \\noncology nursing specialists provide, will lead to a \\ncontinued increase in nursing specialists in hospitals \\nacross Indonesia. When asked about her hopes for \\nthe future, Margareth says, “I think we\\xa0all hope to \\nuse our knowledge to change people’s lives.” \\n\\nBut first, Margareth is looking forward to completing \\nher studies, returning home to her husband and \\nfamily and spending quiet evenings at home. When \\nasked what has most surprised her about working \\nwith cancer patients, she replies, “At\\xa0first, I thought \\nmy patients would learn from me. But then I realised \\nthat I was the one who would be learning from them. \\nThey’ve taught me about the importance of family, \\nand they have shown me how to maintain hope in \\ndifficult times.”\\n\\n\\x0c142\\n\\nFocused on community impact\\n\\nWhen philanthropy is done well, it is a catalyst to \\nmeaningful and sustainable change. This mindset \\nis at the core of our philanthropic strategy, which \\nis organised around four key pillars: humanitarian \\nsupport, community projects, education \\nprogrammes and cultural collaborations.\\n\\nWe take a multi-stakeholder approach with trusted \\npartners on the ground to make our philanthropic \\nambitions a reality. Along the way, we ensure that \\nall of the projects and initiatives we support meet \\nquality, innovation and\\xa0sustainability\\xa0criteria.\\n\\nContributing to healthier communities\\nMany of our philanthropic initiatives help to build \\nstronger, healthier communities where we live, \\nwork\\xa0and beyond. For example, we have been \\nsupporting the International Committee of the \\nRed\\xa0Cross (ICRC) for over 100 years. It’s our \\nlongest-standing partnership – spanning nearly \\nas long as the founding of the company – and has \\ncontinued to evolve ever since. A major focus in \\nrecent years has been helping to improve access \\nto water in Mali,\\xa0where lack of access to this vital \\nresource has\\xa0been acute due to protracted conflict, \\ndrought and limited resources. In 2022, over \\n250,000\\xa0people\\xa0benefitted from this initiative.\\n\\nWe also help to bolster community access to \\nbasic primary healthcare services. We have been \\nsupporting the Transnet Phelophepa healthcare \\ntrains since 1994, providing services that have \\nevolved to meet the most pressing health needs \\nin rural communities in South Africa. In 2022, \\nPhelophepa provided healthcare services to over \\n335,000\\xa0patients, training to over 5,000\\xa0community \\nhealthcare volunteers, and 28\\xa0food gardens to \\nenable more food security in the\\xa0region. \\n\\nThere is perhaps no better example of sustainable \\nchange than providing people with the training \\nneeded to build healthier communities for \\n\\nyears ahead. We are supporting a wide range \\nof\\xa0scholarships in emerging markets (see table \\non page\\xa0143), opening paths to new possibilities \\nthrough the education of new nurses, health \\nworkers, lab technicians and many more. \\n\\nBolstered by employee engagement \\nWe believe that the long-term sustainability of \\nsocietal change relies upon engagement with \\nlocal communities, and that mantra extends to \\nour employees. In fact, our largest employee \\nengagement and philanthropic event began in \\n2003 as an employee-driven pilot across three \\nsites\\xa0– the Roche Children’s Walk. In 2022, \\n145\\xa0sites\\xa0participated in the campaign, across \\n60 countries, garnering the support of over \\n20,000\\xa0employees.

That’s why he works hard to stay current \\non the latest developments in diagnostic technology, \\nand to do whatever is necessary to ensure they are \\navailable to more people in more places. \\n\\nThe task of connecting more people with Roche \\ndiagnostic tools also entails keeping up with \\nchanges to the regulations that govern them. \\nWhen an impending regulatory change in China \\nnecessitated a complete transformation in the way \\na large portion of the company did business, Li\\xa0knew \\nthe entire team faced a particularly difficult\\xa0test. \\n\\nWith 14\\xa0years of experience at Roche Diagnostics, \\nand responsibility for a core line of business, Li \\nwas\\xa0comfortable with professional challenges. But \\nthis regulatory change was a major transformation \\nto a critical business process. There was no room \\nfor error. Li and his team quickly saw that, while it \\nwas likely to be a demanding journey, it was more \\nthan the necessary thing to do. It was also the right \\nthing\\xa0to\\xa0do. \\n\\nShifting needs in a growing market\\nBefore the regulatory change, hospitals and other \\nhealthcare facilities would typically lease diagnostic \\ninstruments. As part of those agreements, the \\nfacility would commit to purchasing a specific \\namount of reagent – the substance used to conduct \\na diagnostic test and produce a result – in order \\nto have the instrument provided for the period of \\nthe\\xa0contract. \\n\\nIn this arrangement, Roche was responsible \\nfor ensuring the instruments were in working \\norder, and\\xa0for repairing or replacing machines \\nas needed.\\xa0In return, the reagent portion of \\nthe\\xa0contracts provided the company with a \\npredictable source of\\xa0revenue. At the time, this \\nindustry-standard model supported the growing \\nhealthcare industry.\\n\\nAs the healthcare market, and particularly the \\ndiagnostic sector, underwent rapid growth in \\nChina, the Chinese government began to question \\nwhether this particular model was actually the \\nbest for patients. In 2017, the National Medical \\nProducts Administration (NMPA) determined \\nthat separating the financial arrangement\\xa0for \\ndiagnostic\\xa0instruments from the financial \\narrangement for reagents would increase agility, \\nallowing hospitals to quickly adopt new instruments \\nand technologies, and a better experience for \\npatients. The new regulations were to take effect \\nbeginning in 2018, with a transition period of \\nseveral\\xa0years.\\n\\nUnderstanding the challenge\\nWhile the regulatory change might have \\nseemed simple on its surface, it was actually a \\nsubstantial modification to the way Roche – and \\nits\\xa0competitors\\xa0– did business. Li and his team \\nwere\\xa0tasked with ensuring that compliance with \\nthe\\xa0new\\xa0regulations was as smooth as possible. \\n\\n“The first reaction, both at Roche and within \\nthe larger industry, was confusion,” explains Li. \\n“Nobody\\xa0understood the rationale.” To gain clarity, \\nthe Roche team began to talk with regulators, ask \\nquestions and work to develop a clearer idea of \\nwhat would be\\xa0required. \\n\\n\\x0c150\\n\\n“Making these changes was part of our \\ninvestment in the country, and part of our \\ncommitment to providing access to quality \\nhealthcare to more people.”\\n\\nThe benefits to patients, which included increased \\ntransparency and access to new technologies, \\nsoon\\xa0became apparent. The impact on Roche \\nbecame evident, as well. Li saw that “because \\nRoche offered high-quality instruments and \\nreagents, and an exceptional level of service, the \\nnew business model was unlikely to negatively \\nimpact our operations.” As he explains, “We \\ncame to see that making these changes was \\npart of our investment in the country, and part of \\nour commitment to providing access to quality \\nhealthcare to more people while transparently \\ncomplying\\xa0with the local regulation.”\\n\\nNow, the task was to make it happen. \\n\\nGathering the team\\nWhile Li was not immediately sure what the path \\nto compliance would be, he did know it would \\nbe a truly cross-functional undertaking. The \\nteam he assembled to develop a strategy for \\nthe transformation included representatives \\nfrom finance, legal, compliance, sales and other \\ndepartments. The group began to connect \\nwith external stakeholders, including hospitals \\nand device distributors, to determine the best \\nways to transition to the new regulations, while \\nminimising\\xa0disruptions. \\n\\nA large portion of the work fell to the sales \\nteam. They worked closely with their customers \\nin hospital\\xa0labs to inventory all of the current \\n\\ninstruments, review thousands of existing \\ncontracts\\xa0to find potential issues and problems, \\nand began to develop solutions. One by one, new \\narrangements were made with customers that \\naligned with the new\\xa0regulations.\\n\\n“It has been a long journey,” says Li. “We were able \\nto complete about 80% of the transition in the first \\ntwo years. But, speaking honestly, the last 20% \\nhas\\xa0been the most difficult part and a great deal \\nof\\xa0work for everyone involved.” \\n\\nKeeping compliance at the centre\\nConducting business ethically and in compliance \\nwith regulations – especially as they change – is \\na core principle at Roche. Li\\xa0elaborates on the \\nvalue Roche places on compliance this way: “It \\nis everywhere. We have a monthly meeting that \\nis focused on compliance. We even call that day \\n‘Compliance Day’. That’s when we update everyone \\non compliance news, discuss any challenges we’re \\nfacing and determine what needs to be done to \\nensure we are always where we need to be.” \\n\\nReady for what’s next\\nEven with this massive undertaking nearly complete, \\nLi is not likely to sit still for long. His lifelong \\ncommitment to staying healthy and active involves \\nswimming, jogging, basketball, badminton and more. \\nNow, his sons are following in his footsteps, showing \\ngreat promise in swimming. It’s all part of a family-\\nwide commitment to keeping up with the pace of life.\\n\\n\\x0cBusiness ethics \\n\\n|  Roche  151\\n\\nAs the healthcare system in China evolves, Li and his colleagues \\n\\nare ensuring that Roche continues to provide access to quality \\n\\nhealthcare for more people. By working with partners across \\n\\nthe healthcare system, we are ensuring compliance with new \\n\\nregulations while minimising disruptions to patients and their \\n\\nhealthcare providers. \\n\\n\\x0c152\\n\\nDemonstrating the value of sustainability\\n\\nSartorius is a global supplier of innovative \\ntechnologies and services that enable Roche and \\nother biotechnology companies to simplify and \\naccelerate progress in biomanufacturing. Matteo \\nAlaria, Sartorius’s Head of Product Sustainability, \\nlives and breathes sustainability. An\\xa0environmental \\nengineer by training, he has combined two of his \\npassions throughout his career – a love of the \\nenvironment and a thirst for all things data-related. \\n\\n“From my first job as a consultant working in a \\nvariety of industries to joining Sartorius in 2022, \\nmy most rewarding experiences have been helping \\norganisations think and act sustainably,” reflects \\nMatteo. “Climate change is one of the biggest \\nchallenges we face as a society today and we \\nmust\\xa0act now to see changes in the future.”\\n\\nFaster access for patients \\nSustainability is one of Sartorius’s three corporate \\nvalues, along with openness and enjoyment. The \\ncompany takes a holistic view to finding resource-\\nefficient and innovative technology solutions \\nthat can help their clients translate new scientific \\ndiscoveries more quickly into effective patient \\ncare, while progressing towards their sustainability \\ngoals. Sartorius looks at the entire value chain, \\nfrom\\xa0research and development and manufacturing \\nthrough to storage and transportation of medicines \\nand vaccines, to speed up the time it takes for \\npatients to benefit from them. Matteo’s role is \\nto ensure all of this happens with sustainability \\nat its core. “We have an ethical responsibility to \\nsupport more access to innovative medicines for \\nmore people, and do it in the most sustainable \\nway\\xa0possible,” Matteo says.\\n\\n“We are constantly pushing ourselves and our own \\nsuppliers to find opportunities to do more with \\nless, to reduce resources and energy use and \\nto look for sustainable solutions in every aspect \\nof our business,” says Matteo. “At the end of the \\nday, everyone will benefit from this approach. \\nOur clients,\\xa0our suppliers, the environment and, \\nultimately, patients.”\\n\\nThe value of collaboration\\nThe biomanufacturing industry is extremely complex \\nand could see faster progress and more benefits \\nfor companies and patients through increased \\ncollaboration and simplification. “There are so many \\nopportunities. We have to speed up sustainability \\nefforts across the industry. We all need to ask \\nourselves questions like ‘can we do better?’, ‘are \\nthere new innovations in single-use technologies \\nthat we could explore?’, ‘can we package this \\nproduct more efficiently?’”\\n\\nMatteo believes Roche, as a leader in the \\nbiotechnology industry, has a great opportunity \\nto pave the way when it comes to industry \\ncollaboration. Through open dialogue with suppliers \\nand partners, we can find\\xa0common ground as an \\nindustry and really embed sustainability across \\nthe board. “Roche is a data-driven company,” he \\nsays. “The only way to connect sustainability with \\nbusiness is to find solutions through data and that \\nis exactly how Roche operates its business. This \\nmindset is critical\\xa0to the future of the industry \\nand we are grateful to collaborate with Roche on \\nmaking\\xa0meaningful change.”\\n\\n\\x0cBusiness ethics \\n\\n|  Roche  153\\n\\nMatteo Alaria\\n\\n\\x0c154\\n\\nMatteo’s lifelong passion for sustainability has propelled him to \\n\\nexplore new and innovative ways to help clients reduce resources \\n\\nand energy use. He believes that companies like Roche can lead \\n\\nthe\\xa0way for the biotechnology industry and help set the standard \\n\\nfor\\xa0how companies can move towards a sustainable future.\\n\\n\\x0cBusiness ethics \\n\\n|  Roche  155\\n\\n“The only way to connect sustainability with \\nbusiness is to find solutions through data \\nand that is exactly how Roche operates \\nits\\xa0business.”\\n\\nKnowledge is power\\nMatteo and the team at Sartorius know that in-depth \\nknowledge of a client’s processes and operations \\nis an integral part of providing what they need. “It’s \\nour job to learn about our clients and how they \\noperate so we can identify the right solutions that \\nwill have the best possible performance,” says \\nMatteo. “Having that 360-degree view helps us \\ncapture opportunities to improve sustainability \\nacross the value chain.”\\n\\nLiving the values\\nAlthough Sartorius is headquartered in Göttingen, \\nGermany, Matteo works from his home office in \\nTorino, Italy, where he grew up. While the COVID-19 \\npandemic sped up remote working approaches, \\n\\nSartorius had taken this approach across many \\nfunctions prior to the pandemic. “I am very \\nappreciative of the work-life balance I have in my \\nrole. It allows me to spend more time with my family \\nwhile still collaborating with colleagues and clients \\naround the world,” reflects Matteo. “Not to mention \\nthe fact that this is a truly sustainable approach \\nto\\xa0working.”\\n\\nWhen considering what the future holds, Matteo \\nspeaks about his three-month-old daughter. “Her \\nfuture is what’s important to me; that’s what drives \\nme to make a difference in whatever way I can. I\\xa0look \\nforward to continuing to work with our clients to \\ndemonstrate value – which is always there when \\nsustainability is at the heart of what we do.”\\n\\n\\x0c156\\n\\nEmbedding ethics and integrity \\nin\\xa0everything we do\\n\\nCompliance\\nWhile maintaining a strong ethical culture \\nremains the main focus of our comprehensive \\ncompliance programme, in 2022 we also \\nfocused on digitalisation and simplification of \\ncompliance processes and controls and ensured \\nour compliance\\xa0experts are\\xa0involved earlier in \\nnew\\xa0business models.\\n\\nSeveral initiatives were concluded and successfully \\nimplemented in 2022, not only leading to early \\ninvolvement of Compliance Officers but also \\ndriving\\xa0line management ownership of our \\nculture of\\xa0integrity and compliance in times \\nof\\xa0transformation: \\n\\n• A harmonised compliance risk and opportunity \\nassessment and management framework was \\nrolled out. This framework allows us to focus \\non the most relevant and biggest risks and \\nopportunities, as well as identify potential gaps \\nand trends. \\n\\n• Our new Business Ethics Incident Management \\nSystem (BEIMS) was successfully implemented, \\nwhich allows us to capture key data in order to \\nbetter understand root causes of non-compliant \\nbehaviours and trends, and act upon them. \\n\\n• In an effort to drive awareness and engagement \\n\\nacross the organisation, we revised and launched \\na simplified version of our Behaviour in Business \\ndirective. Through simpler language and easier \\nnavigation, we can ensure our employees have \\na clear understanding of key topics including \\nconflict of interest and corruption.\\n\\n• We began implementing an improved and \\n\\nstandardised process for all interactions with \\nhealthcare professionals and healthcare \\n\\norganisations. Through a centralised monitoring \\nsystem, we are now able to free up the capacity \\nof our compliance professionals to better support \\nthe business on more complex matters. \\n\\n• We developed a Business Partner Management \\nChecklist that provides a harmonised approach \\nto the management of external business partners \\nand\\xa0promotes our integrity standards globally. \\n\\nHuman rights\\nRoche respects and proactively protects human \\nrights. We are leveraging our current human rights \\nprogramme and moving towards a more holistic \\napproach in the value chain to include our external \\nsuppliers’ human rights programmes. In 2022, \\na cross-functional team further developed our \\nDirective on Human Rights Due Diligence for Third \\nParties, as well as updated the Roche Supplier Code \\nof Conduct with a go-live date of 1\\xa0January\\xa02023. \\nThese initiatives will increase transparency and \\nenhance our human rights programme beyond \\nRoche’s own operations.\\n\\nOne of the ways we ensure compliance with \\nour\\xa0Supplier Code of Conduct is through our \\nSupplier Sustainability Assurance Visit (SSAV) \\nprogramme. We have a formal, risk-based \\nmethod of identifying the suppliers most at risk \\nfor sustainability-related violations, including \\nhuman rights violations. These\\xa0suppliers are \\nsubject to recurring audits through the SSAV \\nprogramme. In\\xa02022, we conducted 51\\xa0SSAVs \\n(16\\xa0in EMEA, 26\\xa0in\\xa0APAC, 3\\xa0in North America and \\n6\\xa0in LATAM). There were 154\\xa0human rights-related \\nobservations.

Principles\\n\\nMotivation, expertise and performance of \\nemployees are key for the success of Roche as \\nan innovative and agile company. This conviction \\nforms\\xa0the basis of our compensation policy. \\n\\nRoche aims to remunerate all employees fairly, \\ntransparently and in line with market conditions, \\nto enable them to participate appropriately in \\nthe company’s success. We pursue this goal by \\nproviding equitable, competitive, performance-\\nbased and results-oriented compensation.\\n\\nWe strive for a balanced mix of fixed and variable \\ncompensation components geared to each \\nemployee’s position and management responsibility.\\n\\nFirstly, the variable components are intended to \\ncreate additional financial incentives to achieve \\ncorporate goals and to keep innovation at a \\nconsistently high level while increasing the value \\nthat the company creates for all stakeholder \\ngroups.\\xa0Secondly, in order to allow employees \\nand\\xa0managers to participate in the company’s \\nbusiness success, adequate compensation \\nmeasures are key. Both objectives are incentivised \\nby annual bonus payments and long-term \\nsecurities-based programmes.\\n\\nFor a global company like Roche, market-\\ncompetitive remuneration plays a key role \\nalong with a performance- and success-based, \\n\\ntransparent compensation structure. To ensure \\nthat compensation packages are competitive, \\nboth the structure and individual components \\nare regularly benchmarked based on the relevant \\nSwiss, European and international market criteria. \\nOur remuneration guidelines and their underlying \\nprinciples are also subject to regular outside \\ncomparisons.\\n\\nHowever, compensation policy is only one \\nfactor\\xa0in safeguarding Roche’s future success. \\nThe key element is a corporate culture that \\noffers employees conditions in which they can \\nmake their best possible contribution to the \\nshared corporate goal of improving healthcare \\nfor patients. This includes a sound and a \\nsustainability-oriented value system that is \\nbased on integrity, courage and passion. At \\nthe same time, our decentralised management \\napproach plays a major role with\\xa0its wide scope \\nfor\\xa0individual decision-making, respectful \\ninteractions, openness to diversity, wide-ranging \\ntraining and development opportunities and an \\nattractive working environment. A unidimensional \\ndiminishment\\xa0to\\xa0questions on remuneration would \\nfall by far too\\xa0short.\\n\\nRoche is committed to a fair, performance-based \\nand results-oriented compensation policy that \\nlinks\\xa0employees’ interests with those of various \\nother stakeholder groups.\\n\\nRoche, the place to work: https://careers.roche.com/global/en\\n\\n\\x0cRemuneration Report \\n\\n|  Roche  185\\n\\n2.

The audit was limited \\nto the information on remuneration, loans and \\nadvances pursuant to Art. 14–16 of the Ordinance \\nagainst Excessive Remuneration in Listed \\nCompanies Limited by Shares (Verordnung gegen \\nübermässige Vergütungen bei börsenkotierten \\nAktiengesellschaften, VegüV) in the sections \\nmarked with a grey line and ‘audited’, including \\nthe respective footnotes, on pages 182 to 207 \\nof the Remuneration Report.\\n\\nIn our opinion, the information on remuneration, \\nloans and advances in the Remuneration Report \\ncomplies with Swiss law and Art. 14–16 VegüV. \\n\\nBasis for Opinion\\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with Swiss \\nlaw and Swiss Standards on Auditing (SA-CH). \\nOur responsibilities under those provisions and \\nstandards are further described in the ‘Auditor’s \\nResponsibilities for the Audit of the Remuneration \\nReport’ section of our report. We are independent \\nof the Company in accordance with the provisions \\nof Swiss law and the requirements of the Swiss \\naudit profession, and we have fulfilled our other \\nethical responsibilities in accordance with these \\nrequirements.\\n\\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have \\nobtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide \\na basis for our opinion.  \\n\\nOther Information\\nThe Board of Directors is responsible for the other \\ninformation. The other information comprises the \\ninformation included in the annual report, but does \\nnot include the sections marked ‘audited’ in the \\nRemuneration Report, the consolidated financial \\n\\nstatements, the financial statements and our \\nauditor’s reports thereon.\\n\\nOur opinion on the Remuneration Report does not \\ncover the other information and we do not express \\nany form of assurance conclusion thereon.\\n\\nIn connection with our audit of the Remuneration \\nReport, our responsibility is to read the other \\ninformation and, in doing so, consider whether the \\nother information is materially inconsistent with the \\naudited financial information in the Remuneration \\nReport or our knowledge obtained in the audit or \\notherwise appears to be materially misstated.\\n\\nIf, based on the work we have performed, we \\nconclude that there is a material misstatement of \\nthis other information, we are required to report \\nthat fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. \\n\\nBoard of Directors’ Responsibilities  \\nfor the Remuneration Report\\nThe Board of Directors is responsible for \\nthe preparation of a Remuneration Report in \\naccordance with the provisions of Swiss law and \\nthe Company’s articles of incorporation, and for \\nsuch internal control as the Board of Directors \\ndetermines is necessary to enable the preparation \\nof a Remuneration Report that is free from material \\nmisstatement, whether due to fraud or error. The \\nBoard of Directors is also responsible for designing \\nthe remuneration system and defining individual \\nremuneration packages. \\n\\nAuditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit  \\nof the Remuneration Report\\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance \\nabout whether the information on remuneration, \\nloans and advances pursuant to Art. 14–16 VegüV \\nis free from material misstatement, whether due \\nto fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cStatutory Auditor’s Report \\n\\n|  Roche  209\\n\\nthat includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance \\nis a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee \\nthat an audit conducted in accordance with Swiss \\nlaw and SA-CH will always detect a material \\nmisstatement when it exists. Misstatements can \\narise from fraud or error and are considered \\nmaterial if, individually or in the aggregate, they \\ncould reasonably be expected to influence the \\neconomic decisions of users taken on the basis \\nof this Remuneration Report.\\n\\n•   Obtain an understanding of internal control \\nrelevant to the audit in order to design audit \\nprocedures that are appropriate in the \\ncircumstances, but not for the purpose of \\nexpressing an opinion on the effectiveness \\nof the Company’s internal control.\\n\\n•   Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting \\n\\npolicies used and the reasonableness \\nof accounting estimates and related \\ndisclosures made.\\n\\nAs part of an audit in accordance with Swiss law \\nand SA-CH, we exercise professional judgement \\nand maintain professional scepticism throughout \\nthe audit. We also:\\n•   Identify and assess the risks of material \\n\\nmisstatement in the Remuneration Report, \\nwhether due to fraud or error, design and \\nperform audit procedures responsive to \\nthose risks, and obtain audit evidence that is \\nsufficient and appropriate to provide a basis \\nfor our opinion. The risk of not detecting a \\nmaterial misstatement resulting from fraud \\nis higher than for one resulting from error, as \\nfraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional \\nomissions, misrepresentations, or the override \\nof internal control.\\n\\nWe communicate with the Board of Directors \\nor its relevant committee regarding, among \\nother matters, the planned scope and timing of \\nthe audit and significant audit findings, including \\nany significant deficiencies in internal control \\nthat we identify during our audit.\\n\\nWe also provide the Board of Directors or its \\nrelevant committee with a statement that we \\nhave complied with relevant ethical requirements \\nregarding independence, and to communicate \\nwith them all relationships and other matters \\nthat may reasonably be thought to bear on our \\nindependence, and where applicable, actions \\ntaken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.\\n\\nKPMG AG\\n\\nFrançois Rouiller  \\nLicensed Audit Expert \\nAuditor in Charge\\n\\nBasel, 31 January 2023\\n\\nPaul Nichols  \\n\\nKPMG AG, Grosspeteranlage 5, CH-4002 Basel\\n\\n© 2023 KPMG AG, a Swiss corporation, is a subsidiary of KPMG Holding AG, which is a member of the KPMG global organization of independent member firms affiliated \\nwith KPMG International Limited, a private English company limited by guarantee.

This responsibility includes the design, \\nimplementation and maintenance of the internal \\ncontrol system related to the preparation of the \\nselected non-financial information that are free \\nof material misstatement, whether due to fraud \\nor error. Furthermore, the Corporate Governance \\nand Sustainability Committee is responsible for \\nthe selection and application of the document \\n“Basis for Preparation of Non-financial Information \\n2022” and adequate record keeping.\\n\\nIndependence and quality management\\nWe are independent of Roche Holding Ltd \\nin accordance with the International Code of \\nEthics for Professional Accountants (including \\nInternational Independence Standards) issued \\nby the International Ethics Standards Board for \\nAccountants (IESBA Code). We have fulfilled our \\nethical responsibilities in accordance with the \\nIESBA Code, which is founded on fundamental \\nprinciples of integrity, objectivity, professional \\ncompetence and due care, confidentiality and \\nprofessional behaviour. \\n\\nPricewaterhouseCoopers AG applies International \\nStandard on Quality Management 1, which \\nrequires the firm to design, implement and \\noperate a system of quality management including \\npolicies or procedures regarding compliance with \\n\\nPractitioner’s responsibility\\nOur responsibility is to perform a limited assurance \\nengagement and to express a conclusion on the \\nselected 2022 non-financial information (including \\nthe GHG emissions) of Roche Group disclosed \\nin the Report. We conducted our engagement in \\naccordance with the International Standard on \\nAssurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 (Revised) \\n‘Assurance engagements other than audits or \\nreviews of historical financial information’ and the \\nInternational Standard on Assurance Engagements \\n3410, Assurance Engagements on Greenhouse \\nGas Statements (‘ISAE 3410’), issued by the \\nInternational Auditing and Assurance Standards \\nBoard. Those standards require that we plan and \\nperform our procedures to obtain limited assurance \\nwhether anything has come to our attention \\nthat causes us to believe that the selected 2022 \\nnon-financial information (including the GHG \\nemissions) was prepared, in all material aspects, \\nin accordance with the document “Basis for \\nPreparation of Non-financial Information 2022”. \\n\\nBased on risk and materiality considerations, we \\nperformed our procedures to obtain sufficient \\nand appropriate assurance evidence. The \\nprocedures selected depend on the assurance \\npractitioner’s judgement. A limited assurance \\nengagement under ISAE 3000 (Revised) and \\nISAE 3410 is substantially less in scope than a \\nreasonable assurance engagement in relation to \\nboth the risk assessment procedures, including \\nan understanding of internal control, and the \\nprocedures performed in response to the assessed \\nrisks. Consequently, the nature, timing and extent \\nof procedures for gathering sufficient appropriate \\nevidence are deliberately limited relative to a \\n\\n\\x0c212\\n\\nreasonable assurance engagement and therefore \\nless assurance is obtained with a limited assurance \\nengagement than for a reasonable assurance \\nengagement. \\n\\nWe performed the following assurance procedures, \\namong others: \\n•  Review of the application of Roche Group \\n\\nguidelines \\nReviewing the application of the Roche Group \\nselected non-financial reporting guidelines \\nas per the document “Basis for Preparation of \\nNon-financial Information 2022”;\\n\\n•  Site visits and management inquiry \\n\\nVisiting selected Pharmaceuticals and \\nDiagnostics sites in Costa Rica, Spain, \\nSwitzerland and the USA. The selection was \\nbased on quantitative and qualitative criteria; \\nInterviewing personnel responsible for internal \\nnon-financial reporting and data collection at \\nthe sites we visited and at the Group level to \\ndetermine the understanding and application of \\nRoche Group’s non-financial reporting guidelines \\nas per the document “Basis for Preparation of \\nNon-financial Information 2022”;\\n\\n•  Assessment of the key figures \\n\\nPerforming tests on a sample basis of evidence \\nsupporting selected people and SHE key figures \\n(e.g. energy consumption, emissions into the air, \\nwater usage and discharge, and share of women \\nin executive positions) concerning completeness, \\naccuracy, adequacy and consistency;\\n\\n•  Review of documentation and analysis of relevant \\n\\npolicies and principles  \\nReviewing relevant documentation on a sample \\nbasis, including Roche Group non-financial \\nreporting policies, management of reporting \\nstructures and documentation;\\n\\n•  Assessment of the processes and data \\n\\nconsolidation \\nReviewing the management and non-financial \\nreporting processes for people and SHE key \\nfigures; and \\nAssessing the aggregation process of data at \\nRoche Group level.\\n\\nWe believe that the evidence we have obtained \\nis sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for \\nour conclusion.\\n\\nConclusion\\nBased on the work we performed, nothing has \\ncome to our attention that causes us to believe \\nthat the selected 2022 non-financial information \\n(including the GHG emissions) of Roche \\nGroup for the period from 1 January 2022 to \\n31 December 2022 disclosed in the Report is not \\nprepared, in all material respects, in accordance \\nwith the document “Basis for Preparation of \\nNon-financial Information 2022”.\\n\\nIntended users and purpose of the report\\nThis report is prepared for, and only for, the \\nCorporate Governance and Sustainability \\nCommittee of Roche Holding Ltd, and solely for \\nthe purpose of reporting to them on selected 2022 \\nnon-financial information (including the GHG \\nemissions) disclosed in the Report and no other \\npurpose.

We stayed focused \\nand continued to innovate and accelerate the \\ngrowth of our company. \\n\\nNow at the halfway mark, it’s clear our strategy \\nis working. We achieved our financial targets and \\nmore importantly the performance of our priority \\nassets in Specialty Care and Vaccines, along with \\nthe reinvention of our General Medicines and \\nConsumer Healthcare Businesses, are keeping \\nus on track.\\n\\nWe are approaching the steady state of transformative \\nlaunches and breakthrough clinical data that we \\nenvisioned in 2020. By reinvesting in R&D, we have \\nquickly transformed our pipeline to be almost \\nexclusively first- and/or best-in-class targets that \\nhave the potential to shift treatment paradigms \\nfor diseases impacting millions.\\n\\nWe’ve also doubled down on our quest to improve \\nthe health and well-being of society and the \\nplanet. We launched the Sanofi Global Health \\nImpact Brand and Fund to expand access to \\nmedicines and are reimagining what corporate \\nphilanthropy can achieve though Foundation S – \\nThe Sanofi Collective. When it comes to climate \\nchange, we’re taking a 360° approach, building \\nthe road to carbon neutrality by 2030 and net zero \\nby 2045, and supporting methods to deal with \\nclimate change in the most vulnerable communities.\\n\\nFurthermore, we are reshaping our own culture with a \\nfocus on diversity, equity, and inclusion in and beyond the \\nworkplace with initiatives like the launch of our DE&I Board \\nand global Employee Resource Groups.\\n\\nOur progress is also reflected in our new corporate brand \\nidentity and purpose which we unveiled in February 2022. \\nThis new identity represents the next chapter in Sanofi’s \\nhistory, where we will move forward together as one \\ncompany united in a shared purpose to chase the miracles \\nof science to improve people’s lives.\\n\\nWe are working hard to become the Sanofi we’ve always \\naspired to be—a truly modern healthcare company \\ntransforming the practice of medicine for millions of \\npeople across the world. \\n\\nPaul Hudson, Chief Executive Officer\\n\\n Hear the Voices Behind our Purpose\\n\\n“The end of 2022 marked \\nthe successful execution of \\nthe first chapter of Play to Win, \\nour 2020-2025 strategy designed \\nto make Sanofi a modern \\nhealthcare company.”\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cIntegrated Annual Report 2022\\n\\n04\\n\\nOur Play to Win Strategy\\nin 2022\\n\\nAt the half-way point of our strategy, we’re gaining on our ambition to transform \\nthe practice of medicine through breakthrough science.

Today, this process \\nis fully digital and takes just two minutes \\ninstead of 15 days.\\n\\nAI is also central to our work on vaccines. For \\nan mRNA vaccine to reach its designated cells \\nand produce disease-fighting proteins, it must \\nbe carried by a stable drug delivery system via a \\nspecial particle. We have a large library of special \\nparticles in our labs, and in 2022, we used AI to \\ncreate two digital models to predict the strongest \\nselection of particles, saving countless hours \\nexploring what does and doesn’t work.\\n\\nOur digital tools don’t just speed up our R&D— \\nthey also help us get treatments to patients more \\neffectively. Turing, an app launched in 2022, \\nprovides our sales teams with actionable insights, \\nsuggesting how best to reach out to customers \\nand healthcare professionals and ultimately \\nachieve better outcomes for patients.\\n\\nNadia Schryvers, \\nSenior Associate Scientist, Belgium\\n\\nFueling innovation with new partners and platforms\\n\\nIn 2022, we boosted our AI competencies in new ways:\\n\\n•  We acquired Amunix Pharmaceuticals, which uses AI to \\ntailor-deliver medicines that become active only in tumor \\ntissues, while not harming normal ones.\\n\\n•  We partnered with pharmaceutical companies Insilico \\nMedicine and Atomwise, to speed up medicine development \\nusing their AI-driven platforms.\\n\\nRead more about our AI partnerships on page 10\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cIntegrated Annual Report 2022 | Chasing the Miracles of Science\\n\\n20\\n\\nA Digital Accelerator\\nSpeeding us into the Future\\n\\nLaunched in 2022, our internal startup the Digital Accelerator \\naims to deliver new ways for patients, healthcare professionals, \\nand Sanofians to engage with each other.\\n\\nIn one year, the Digital Accelerator has developed \\na number of ways to support patients with atopic \\ndermatitis in France and Spain.

At least half of the world’s population are unable to \\naccess essential care,(1) or healthcare costs tip many families into poverty.(2) That’s why \\nimproving access to affordable health care is at the core of our social impact strategy. \\n\\nWe’re tackling the problem in several ways. In \\nJuly 2022, we launched the Impact brand under \\nour non-profit business, the Global Health Unit \\n(GHU). Through this brand, we are making 30 \\nmedicines, deemed essential by the WHO, \\navailable at affordable prices to 40 of the world’s \\nlowest-income countries.

For patients, a rapid, close-to-home \\ndiagnosis is followed by a single dose on the same \\nday, with no need to go to hospital. Healthcare \\nprofessionals can make a diagnosis with a simple \\npinprick blood test, so minimal training is required.\\n\\nIf approved, acoziborole could represent the last \\nleg in a fight we began in 2001.

These voluntary, employee- \\nled groups share knowledge and resources on focus \\nareas, from gender or cultural equity, to mental \\nwellbeing. Each group is sponsored by a member \\nof our Executive Committee who acts as an ally \\nfor these communities at senior leadership level.\\n\\nAllyship helps us drive change. It means speaking \\nup for under-represented communities and taking \\naction to help achieve equity and inclusion. Our \\nERGs co-created an allyship guide to help people \\ndo just that, while broadening their understanding \\nof these communities and the discrimination \\nthey may face.\\n\\nLife that works \\n\\n2022 was a big year for improving work-life balance. \\nWe rolled out our gender-neutral parental leave \\npolicy, so every employee is guaranteed at least \\n14 weeks of paid leave. Combined with our existing \\nglobal flexible working policy, Sanofians can\\n\\nmore easily reconcile their personal lives \\nwith day-to-day work.\\n\\nAnd to make sure employee wellbeing stays \\na priority, last year we started the “All Well” \\nprogram—a one-stop-shop for financial, \\nphysical, mental, and social health resources. \\nIntegral to the approach is the Employee \\nAssistance Program, which allows Sanofians \\nto speak confidentially with a counselor, \\nday or night, any day of the year.\\n\\n Hear Sanofians Bruno and Pedro discuss \\nwhat Employee Resource Groups mean to them\\n\\nFolake Odediran, \\nGlobal Culture and Origins+ ERG lead \\nand Country Lead, Nigeria-Ghana\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cIntegrated Annual Report 2022 | Improving People’s Lives\\n\\n35\\n\\nPractical Tools for\\nan Accessible Workplace\\n\\nIn 2022, we examined every possible barrier to our employees \\nachieving their potential and then set out to remove them. \\n\\nEvery voice counts \\n\\nIn our second annual employee engagement \\nsurvey, our colleagues shared their opinions \\non how our organization is building a diverse \\nworkforce and creating an inclusive environment. \\nWe scored 8 out of 10 on our internal diversity \\nindex, so while we’ve made progress, we still have \\nwork to do before all our employees feel part of \\na representative and inclusive workplace.\\n\\nTo break down obstacles for our employees with \\ndisabilities, visible or invisible, we’re improving \\nphysical and digital accessibility. In 2022, we \\nconducted an accessibility audit of 100 sites to set \\nout the steps that will make all our locations fully \\naccessible by 2025. These range from ensuring \\nstep-free access for wheelchair users, to making \\nTadeo—a computer-assisted solution that helps \\ncommunication with people who are deaf or hard \\nof hearing—available to all employees. \\n\\nTo carry out the audit, we used a global accessibility \\nstandard co-developed by our Ability+ Employee \\nResource Group, facilities, safety, and DE&I \\nteams, and an external experience-design firm. \\nWe shared this standard with the Valuable 500, \\na collective of CEOs and companies working \\ntoward disability inclusion. \\n\\n Discover Raimunda’s story as a deaf \\nperson working at Sanofi\\n\\nAndria Cox,\\nHead of Learning Solutions - Medical Learning Institute\\nGlobal Ability+ ERG Lead\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cIntegrated Annual Report 2022 | Improving People’s Lives\\n\\n36\\n\\nChampioning DE&I:\\nIn and Beyond the Workplace\\n\\nWe advocate for DE&I for every employee and are now \\nextending that approach to our external stakeholders. \\n\\nWe want to have a positive social impact that \\ngoes beyond health and strengthens economic \\nengagement with the communities we serve.

Generative AI’s impact on \\n\\nproductivity could add trillions \\nof dollars in value to the global \\neconomy. Our latest research \\nestimates that generative AI could \\nadd the equivalent of $2.6 trillion \\nto $4.4 trillion annually across the \\n63 use cases we analyzed—by \\ncomparison, the United Kingdom’s \\nentire GDP in 2021 was $3.1 trillion. \\nThis would increase the impact of \\nall artificial intelligence by 15 to \\n40 percent. This estimate would \\nroughly double if we include the \\nimpact of embedding generative AI \\ninto software that is currently used \\nfor other tasks beyond those use \\ncases.\\n\\n2.  About 75 percent of the value that \\ngenerative AI use cases could \\ndeliver falls across four areas: \\nCustomer operations, marketing \\nand sales, software engineering, \\nand R&D. Across 16 business \\nfunctions, we examined 63 use \\ncases in which the technology \\ncan address specific business \\nchallenges in ways that produce \\none or more measurable outcomes. \\nExamples include generative AI’s \\nability to support interactions \\nwith customers, generate creative \\ncontent for marketing and sales, \\nand draft computer code based on \\nnatural-language prompts, among \\nmany other tasks. \\n\\n3.  Generative AI will have a significant \\nimpact across all industry sectors. \\nBanking, high tech, and life \\nsciences are among the industries \\nthat could see the biggest impact \\nas a percentage of their revenues \\nfrom generative AI. Across the \\nbanking industry, for example, the \\ntechnology could deliver value \\n\\nequal to an additional $200 billion \\nto $340 billion annually if the use \\ncases were fully implemented. In \\nretail and consumer packaged \\ngoods, the potential impact is also \\nsignificant at $400 billion to $660 \\nbillion a year.\\n\\n4.  Generative AI has the potential \\nto change the anatomy of work, \\naugmenting the capabilities of \\nindividual workers by automating \\nsome of their individual activities. \\nCurrent generative AI and other \\ntechnologies have the potential to \\nautomate work activities that absorb \\n60 to 70 percent of employees’ time \\ntoday. In contrast, we previously \\nestimated that technology has the \\npotential to automate half of the \\ntime employees spend working.1 \\nThe acceleration in the potential for \\ntechnical automation is largely due \\nto generative AI’s increased ability \\nto understand natural language, \\nwhich is required for work activities \\nthat account for 25 percent of total \\nwork time. Thus, generative AI has \\nmore impact on knowledge work \\nassociated with occupations that \\nhave higher wages and educational \\nrequirements than on other types \\nof work.\\n\\n5.  The pace of workforce \\n\\ntransformation is likely to \\naccelerate, given increases in the \\npotential for technical automation. \\nOur updated adoption scenarios, \\nincluding technology development, \\neconomic feasibility, and diffusion \\ntimelines, lead to estimates that \\nhalf of today’s work activities could \\nbe automated between 2030 and \\n2060, with a midpoint in 2045, or \\nroughly a decade earlier than in our \\nprevious estimates.\\n\\n6.  Generative AI can substantially \\n\\nincrease labor productivity across \\nthe economy, but that will require \\ninvestments to support workers \\nas they shift work activities or \\nchange jobs. Generative AI could \\nenable labor productivity growth \\nof 0.1 to 0.6 percent annually \\nthrough 2040, depending on the \\nrate of technology adoption and \\nredeployment of worker time \\ninto other activities. Combining \\ngenerative AI with all other \\ntechnologies, work automation \\ncould add 0.2 to 3.3 percentage \\npoints annually to productivity \\ngrowth. However, workers will need \\nsupport in learning new skills, and \\nsome will change occupations. If \\nworker transitions and other risks \\ncan be managed, generative AI \\ncould contribute substantively to \\neconomic growth and support a \\nmore sustainable, inclusive world. \\n\\n7.  The era of generative AI is just \\n\\nbeginning. Excitement over this \\ntechnology is palpable, and early \\npilots are compelling. But a full \\nrealization of the technology’s \\nbenefits will take time, and leaders \\nin business and society still \\nhave considerable challenges to \\naddress. These include managing \\nthe risks inherent in generative \\nAI, determining what new skills \\nand capabilities the workforce will \\nneed, and rethinking core business \\nprocesses such as retraining and \\ndeveloping new skills.\\n\\nThe economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier\\n\\n3\\n\\n\\x0c1\\n\\nGenerative AI as a \\ntechnology catalyst\\n\\nTo grasp what lies ahead requires an understanding of the breakthroughs that have enabled \\nthe rise of generative AI, which were decades in the making. ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, Stable \\nDiffusion, and other generative AI tools that have captured current public attention are the \\nresult of significant levels of investment in recent years that have helped advance machine \\nlearning and deep learning. This investment undergirds the AI applications embedded in many \\nof the products and services we use every day. \\n\\nBut because AI has permeated our lives incrementally—through everything from the tech \\npowering our smartphones to autonomous-driving features on cars to the tools retailers use \\nto surprise and delight consumers—its progress was almost imperceptible. Clear milestones, \\nsuch as when AlphaGo, an AI-based program developed by DeepMind, defeated a world \\nchampion Go player in 2016, were celebrated but then quickly faded from the public’s \\nconsciousness.\\n\\nChatGPT and its competitors have captured the imagination of people around the world \\nin a way AlphaGo did not, thanks to their broad utility—almost anyone can use them to \\ncommunicate and create—and preternatural ability to have a conversation with a user. \\nThe latest generative AI applications can perform a range of routine tasks, such as the \\nreorganization and classification of data. But it is their ability to write text, compose music, \\nand create digital art that has garnered headlines and persuaded consumers and households \\nto experiment on their own. As a result, a broader set of stakeholders are grappling with \\ngenerative AI’s impact on business and society but without much context to help them make \\nsense of it.\\n\\n4\\n\\nThe economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier\\n\\n\\x0cHow did we get here? Gradually, then all of a sudden \\n\\nFor the purposes of this report, we define generative AI as applications typically built using \\nfoundation models. These models contain expansive artificial neural networks inspired by the \\nbillions of neurons connected in the human brain. Foundation models are part of what is called \\ndeep learning, a term that alludes to the many deep layers within neural networks. Deep \\nlearning has powered many of the recent advances in AI, but the foundation models powering \\ngenerative AI applications are a step change evolution within deep learning. Unlike previous \\ndeep learning models, they can process extremely large and varied sets of unstructured data \\nand perform more than one task. \\n\\nFoundation models have enabled new capabilities and vastly improved existing ones across \\na broad range of modalities, including images, video, audio, and computer code. AI trained \\non these models can perform several functions; it can classify, edit, summarize, answer \\nquestions, and draft new content, among other tasks. \\n\\nContinued innovation will also bring new challenges. For example, the computational power \\nrequired to train generative AI with hundreds of billions of parameters threatens to become a \\nbottleneck in development.2 Further, there’s a significant move—spearheaded by the open-\\nsource community and spreading to the leaders of generative AI companies themselves—to \\nmake AI more responsible, which could increase its costs. \\n\\nNonetheless, funding for generative AI, though still a fraction of total investments in artificial \\nintelligence, is significant and growing rapidly—reaching a total of $12 billion in the first five \\nmonths of 2023 alone. Venture capital and other private external investments in generative \\nAI increased by an average compound growth rate of 74 percent annually from 2017 to 2022. \\nDuring the same period, investments in artificial intelligence overall rose annually by 29 \\npercent, albeit from a higher base. \\n\\nThe rush to throw money at all things generative AI reflects how quickly its capabilities have \\ndeveloped. ChatGPT was released in November 2022. Four months later, OpenAI released \\na new large language model, or LLM, called GPT-4 with markedly improved capabilities.3 \\nSimilarly, by May 2023, Anthropic’s generative AI, Claude, was able to process 100,000 \\ntokens of text, equal to about 75,000 words in a minute—the length of the average novel—\\ncompared with roughly 9,000 tokens when it was introduced in March 2023.4 And in May \\n2023, Google announced several new features powered by generative AI, including Search \\nGenerative Experience and a new LLM called PaLM 2 that will power its Bard chatbot, among \\nother Google products.5\\n\\nFrom a geographic perspective, external private investment in generative AI, mostly from \\ntech giants and venture capital firms, is largely concentrated in North America, reflecting the \\ncontinent’s current domination of the overall AI investment landscape. Generative AI–related \\ncompanies based in the United States raised about $8 billion from 2020 to 2022, accounting \\nfor 75 percent of total investments in such companies during that period.6 \\n\\nGenerative AI has stunned and excited the world with its potential for reshaping how \\nknowledge work gets done in industries and business functions across the entire economy. \\nAcross functions such as sales and marketing, customer operations, and software \\ndevelopment, it is poised to transform roles and boost performance. In the process, it could \\nunlock trillions of dollars in value across sectors from banking to life sciences. We have used \\ntwo overlapping lenses in this report to understand the potential for generative AI to create \\nvalue for companies and alter the workforce. The following sections share our initial findings. \\n\\nThe economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier\\n\\n5\\n\\n\\x0cGlossary\\n\\nApplication programming interface (API) is a way to programmatically access (usually \\nexternal) models, data sets, or other pieces of software.\\n\\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is the ability of software to perform tasks that traditionally require \\nhuman intelligence.\\n\\nArtificial neural networks (ANNs) are composed of interconnected layers of software-based \\ncalculators known as “neurons.” These networks can absorb vast amounts of input data and \\nprocess that data through multiple layers that extract and learn the data’s features.\\n\\nDeep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses deep neural networks, which are \\nlayers of connected “neurons” whose connections have parameters or weights that can be \\ntrained. It is especially effective at learning from unstructured data such as images, text, and \\naudio.\\n\\nEarly and late scenarios are the extreme scenarios of our work-automation model. The \\n“earliest” scenario flexes all parameters to the extremes of plausible assumptions, resulting in \\nfaster automation development and adoption, and the “latest” scenario flexes all parameters \\nin the opposite direction. The reality is likely to fall somewhere between the two.\\n\\nFine-tuning is the process of adapting a pretrained foundation model to perform better in \\na specific task. This entails a relatively short period of training on a labeled data set, which \\nis much smaller than the data set the model was initially trained on. This additional training \\nallows the model to learn and adapt to the nuances, terminology, and specific patterns found \\nin the smaller data set.\\n\\nFoundation models (FM) are deep learning models trained on vast quantities of \\nunstructured, unlabeled data that can be used for a wide range of tasks out of the box or \\nadapted to specific tasks through fine-tuning. Examples of these models are GPT-4, PaLM, \\nDALL·E 2, and Stable Diffusion.\\n\\nGenerative AI is AI that is typically built using foundation models and has capabilities that \\nearlier AI did not have, such as the ability to generate content. Foundation models can also \\nbe used for nongenerative purposes (for example, classifying user sentiment as negative or \\npositive based on call transcripts) while offering significant improvement over earlier models. \\nFor simplicity, when we refer to generative AI in this article, we include all foundation model \\nuse cases.\\n\\nGraphics processing units (GPUs) are computer chips that were originally developed for \\nproducing computer graphics (such as for video games) and are also useful for deep learning \\napplications. In contrast, traditional machine learning and other analyses usually run on \\ncentral processing units (CPUs), normally referred to as a computer’s “processor.”\\n\\nLarge language models (LLMs) make up a class of foundation models that can process \\nmassive amounts of unstructured text and learn the relationships between words or portions \\nof words, known as tokens. This enables LLMs to generate natural-language text, performing \\ntasks such as summarization or knowledge extraction. GPT-4 (which underlies ChatGPT) and \\nLaMDA (the model behind Bard) are examples of LLMs.\\n\\n6\\n\\nThe economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier\\n\\n\\x0cMachine learning (ML) is a subset of AI in which a model gains capabilities after it is trained \\non, or shown, many example data points. Machine learning algorithms detect patterns and \\nlearn how to make predictions and recommendations by processing data and experiences, \\nrather than by receiving explicit programming instruction. The algorithms also adapt and can \\nbecome more effective in response to new data and experiences.\\n\\nModality is a high-level data category such as numbers, text, images, video, and audio.\\n\\nProductivity from labor is the ratio of GDP to total hours worked in the economy. Labor \\nproductivity growth comes from increases in the amount of capital available to each worker, \\nthe education and experience of the workforce, and improvements in technology.\\n\\nPrompt engineering refers to the process of designing, refining, and optimizing input \\nprompts to guide a generative AI model toward producing desired (that is, accurate) outputs.\\n\\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention, is a mechanism that aims to mimic cognitive \\nattention, relating different positions of a single sequence to compute a representation of the \\nsequence.\\n\\nStructured data are tabular data (for example, organized in tables, databases, or \\nspreadsheets) that can be used to train some machine learning models effectively.\\n\\nTransformers are a relatively new neural network architecture that relies on self-attention \\nmechanisms to transform a sequence of inputs into a sequence of outputs while focusing its \\nattention on important parts of the context around the inputs. Transformers do not rely on \\nconvolutions or recurrent neural networks.\\n\\nTechnical automation potential refers to the share of the worktime that could be automated. \\nWe assessed the technical potential for automation across the global economy through \\nan analysis of the component activities of each occupation. We used databases published \\nby institutions including the World Bank and the US Bureau of Labor Statistics to break \\ndown about 850 occupations into approximately 2,100 activities, and we determined the \\nperformance capabilities needed for each activity based on how humans currently perform \\nthem.\\n\\nUse cases are targeted applications to a specific business challenge that produces one \\nor more measurable outcomes. For example, in marketing, generative AI could be used to \\ngenerate creative content such as personalized emails.\\n\\nUnstructured data lack a consistent format or structure (for example, text, images, and audio \\nfiles) and typically require more advanced techniques to extract insights.\\n\\nThe economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier\\n\\n7\\n\\n\\x0c2\\n\\nGenerative AI use \\ncases across functions \\nand industries \\n\\nGenerative AI is a step change in the evolution of artificial intelligence. As companies \\nrush to adapt and implement it, understanding the technology’s potential to deliver value \\nto the economy and society at large will help shape critical decisions. We have used two \\ncomplementary lenses to determine where generative AI with its current capabilities could \\ndeliver the biggest value and how big that value could be (Exhibit 1).\\n\\n8\\n\\nThe economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier\\n\\n\\x0cExhibit 1\\n\\nThe potential impact of generative AI can be evaluated through two lenses.\\n\\nLens 1\\nTotal economic \\npotential of 60-plus \\norganizational use \\ncases1\\n\\nLens 2\\nLabor productivity potential \\nacross ~2,100 detailed work \\nactivities performed by \\nglobal workforce \\n\\nCost impacts \\nof use cases\\n\\nRevenue \\nimpacts of \\nuse cases1\\n\\n1For quantitative analysis, revenue impacts were recast as productivity increases on the corresponding spend in order to maintain comparability with cost \\nimpacts and not to assume additional growth in any particular market.\\n\\nMcKinsey & Company\\n\\nThe first lens scans use cases for generative AI that organizations could adopt. We define \\na “use case” as a targeted application of generative AI to a specific business challenge, \\nresulting in one or more measurable outcomes. For example, a use case in marketing is the \\napplication of generative AI to generate creative content such as personalized emails, the \\nmeasurable outcomes of which potentially include reductions in the cost of generating such \\ncontent and increases in revenue from the enhanced effectiveness of higher-quality content \\nat scale. We identified 63 generative AI use cases spanning 16 business functions that could \\ndeliver total value in the range of $2.6 trillion to $4.4 trillion in economic benefits annually \\nwhen applied across industries. \\n\\nThat would add 15 to 40 percent to the $11.0 trillion to $17.7 trillion of economic value that we \\nnow estimate nongenerative artificial intelligence and analytics could unlock. (Our previous \\nestimate from 2017 was that AI could deliver $9.5 trillion to $15.4 trillion in economic value.) \\n\\nOur second lens complements the first by analyzing generative AI’s potential impact on \\nthe work activities required in some 850 occupations. We modeled scenarios to estimate \\nwhen generative AI could perform each of more than 2,100 “detailed work activities”—\\nsuch as “communicating with others about operational plans or activities”—that make up \\nthose occupations across the world economy. This enables us to estimate how the current \\ncapabilities of generative AI could affect labor productivity across all work currently done by \\nthe global workforce.\\n\\nThe economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier\\n\\n9\\n\\n\\x0cSome of this impact will overlap with cost reductions in the use case analysis described \\nabove, which we assume are the result of improved labor productivity. Netting out this \\noverlap, the total economic benefits of generative AI—including the major use cases we \\nexplored and the myriad increases in productivity that are likely to materialize when the \\ntechnology is applied across knowledge workers’ activities—amounts to $6.1 trillion to \\n$7.9 trillion annually (Exhibit 2).\\n\\nExhibit 2\\n\\nGenerative AI could create additional value potential above what \\ncould be unlocked by other AI and analytics.\\n\\nAI’s potential impact on the global economy, $ trillion\\n\\n13.6–22.1\\n\\n6.1–7.9\\n\\n17.1–25.6\\n\\n11.0–17.7\\n\\n2.6–4.4\\n\\n~15–40% \\nincremental \\neconomic impact\\n\\n~35–70% \\nincremental \\neconomic impact\\n\\nAdvanced analytics,\\ntraditional machine\\nlearning, and deep\\nlearning1\\n\\nNew generative\\nAI use cases\\n\\nTotal use\\ncase-driven\\npotential\\n\\nAll worker productivity\\nenabled by generative\\nAI, including in use\\ncases\\n\\nTotal AI\\neconomic\\npotential\\n\\n1Updated use case estimates from \"Notes from the AI frontier: Applications and value of deep learning,” McKinsey Global Institute, April 17, 2018.\\n\\nMcKinsey & Company\\n\\n10\\n\\nThe economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier\\n\\n\\x0cWhile generative AI is an exciting and rapidly advancing technology, the other applications of \\nAI discussed in our previous report continue to account for the majority of the overall potential \\nvalue of AI. Traditional advanced-analytics and machine learning algorithms are highly \\neffective at performing numerical and optimization tasks such as predictive modeling, and \\nthey continue to find new applications in a wide range of industries. However, as generative AI \\ncontinues to develop and mature, it has the potential to open wholly new frontiers in creativity \\nand innovation. It has already expanded the possibilities of what AI overall can achieve (please \\nsee Box 1, “How we estimated the value potential of generative AI use cases”).\\n\\nBox 1\\nHow we estimated the value potential of generative AI use cases\\n\\nTo assess the potential value of generative AI, \\nwe updated a proprietary McKinsey database of \\npotential AI use cases and drew on the experience \\nof more than 100 experts in industries and their \\nbusiness functions.1 Our updates examined \\nuse cases of generative AI—specifically, how \\ngenerative AI techniques (primarily transformer-\\nbased neural networks) can be used to solve \\nproblems not well addressed by previous \\ntechnologies.\\n\\nWe analyzed only use cases for which generative \\nAI could deliver a significant improvement in the \\noutputs that drive key value. In particular, our \\nestimates of the primary value the technology \\ncould unlock do not include use cases for which \\nthe sole benefit would be its ability to use natural \\nlanguage. For example, natural-language \\ncapabilities would be the key driver of value in \\n\\na customer service use case but not in a use \\ncase optimizing a logistics network, where value \\nprimarily arises from quantitative analysis. \\n\\nWe then estimated the potential annual value \\nof these generative AI use cases if they were \\nadopted across the entire economy. For use \\ncases aimed at increasing revenue, such as some \\nof those in sales and marketing, we estimated \\nthe economy-wide value generative AI could \\ndeliver by increasing the productivity of sales and \\nmarketing expenditures. \\n\\nOur estimates are based on the structure of the \\nglobal economy in 2022 and do not consider the \\nvalue generative AI could create if it produced \\nentirely new product or service categories.\\n\\n1 \\n\\n“Notes from the AI frontier: Applications and value of deep learning,” McKinsey Global Institute, April 17, 2018.\\n\\nIn this chapter, we highlight the value potential of generative AI across two dimensions: \\nbusiness function and modality. \\n\\nThe economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier\\n\\n11\\n\\n\\x0cValue potential by function\\n\\nWhile generative AI could have an impact on most business functions, a few stand out when \\nmeasured by the technology’s impact as a share of functional cost (Exhibit 3). Our analysis \\nof 16 business functions identified just four—customer operations, marketing and sales, \\nsoftware engineering, and research and development—that could account for approximately \\n75 percent of the total annual value from generative AI use cases.\\n\\nWeb <2023>\\nExhibit 3\\n<Vivatech full report>\\nExhibit <3> of <16>\\n\\nUsing generative AI in just a few functions could drive most of the technology’s \\nimpact across potential corporate use cases.\\n\\nImpact, $ billion\\n\\n500\\n\\n400\\n\\n300\\n\\n200\\n\\n100\\n\\n0\\n\\n0\\n\\nRepresent ~75% of total annual impact of generative AI\\n\\nSales\\n\\nMarketing\\n\\nSoftware engineering\\n(for corporate IT)\\n\\nSoftware engineering\\n(for product development)\\n\\nCustomer operations\\n\\nProduct and R&D1\\n\\nSupply chain\\n\\nManufacturing\\n\\nFinance\\n\\nRisk and compliance\\n\\nTalent and organization (incl HR)\\n\\nProcurement management\\n\\nCorporate IT1\\n\\nLegal\\n\\nStrategy\\n\\nPricing\\n\\n10\\n\\n20\\n\\n30\\n\\n40\\n\\nImpact as a percentage of functional spend, % \\n\\nNote: Impact is averaged.\\n¹Excluding software engineering.\\nSource: Comparative Industry Service (CIS), IHS Markit; Oxford Economics; McKinsey Corporate and Business Functions database; McKinsey Manufacturing \\nand Supply Chain 360; McKinsey Sales Navigator; Ignite, a McKinsey database; McKinsey analysis \\n\\nMcKinsey & Company\\n\\nNotably, the potential value of using generative AI for several functions that were prominent \\nin our previous sizing of AI use cases, including manufacturing and supply chain functions, \\nis now much lower.7 This is largely explained by the nature of generative AI use cases, which \\nexclude most of the numerical and optimization applications that were the main value drivers \\nfor previous applications of AI.\\n\\n12\\n\\nThe economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier\\n\\n\\x0cGenerative AI as a virtual expert\\nIn addition to the potential value generative AI can deliver in function-specific use cases, \\nthe technology could drive value across an entire organization by revolutionizing internal \\nknowledge management systems. Generative AI’s impressive command of natural-language \\nprocessing can help employees retrieve stored internal knowledge by formulating queries \\nin the same way they might ask a human a question and engage in continuing dialogue. This \\ncould empower teams to quickly access relevant information, enabling them to rapidly make \\nbetter-informed decisions and develop effective strategies.\\n\\nIn 2012, the McKinsey Global Institute (MGI) estimated that knowledge workers spent about \\na fifth of their time, or one day each work week, searching for and gathering information. If \\ngenerative AI could take on such tasks, increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of the \\nworkers doing them, the benefits would be huge. Such virtual expertise could rapidly “read” \\nvast libraries of corporate information stored in natural language and quickly scan source \\nmaterial in dialogue with a human who helps fine-tune and tailor its research, a more scalable \\nsolution than hiring a team of human experts for the task. \\n\\nFollowing are examples of how generative AI could produce operational benefits as a virtual \\nexpert in a handful of use cases.\\n\\nIn addition to the potential \\nvalue generative AI can \\ndeliver in specific use \\ncases, the technology \\ncould drive value across \\nan entire organization \\nby revolutionizing \\ninternal knowledge \\nmanagement systems.\\n\\nThe economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier\\n\\n13\\n\\n\\x0cHow customer operations \\ncould be transformed\\n\\nCustomer self-service interactions\\n\\nCustomer interacts with a humanlike chatbot that \\ndelivers immediate, personalized responses to \\ncomplex inquiries, ensuring a consistent brand \\nvoice regardless of customer language or location. \\n\\nCustomer–agent interactions\\n\\nHuman agent uses AI-developed call scripts and \\nreceives real-time assistance and suggestions for \\nresponses during phone conversations, instantly \\naccessing relevant customer data for tailored and \\nreal-time information delivery. \\n\\nAgent self-improvement\\n\\nAgent receives a summarization of the conversation in \\na few succinct points to create a record of customer \\ncomplaints and actions taken.\\n\\nAgent uses automated, personalized insights generated \\nby AI, including tailored follow-up messages or \\npersonalized coaching suggestions. \\n\\n14\\n\\nThe economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier\\n\\n\\x0cCustomer operations\\nGenerative AI has the potential to revolutionize the entire customer operations function, \\nimproving the customer experience and agent productivity through digital self-service \\nand enhancing and augmenting agent skills. The technology has already gained traction \\nin customer service because of its ability to automate interactions with customers using \\nnatural language. Research found that at one company with 5,000 customer service \\nagents, the application of generative AI increased issue resolution by 14 percent an hour and \\nreduced the time spent handling an issue by 9 percent.8 It also reduced agent attrition and \\nrequests to speak to a manager by 25 percent. Crucially, productivity and quality of service \\nimproved most among less-experienced agents, while the AI assistant did not increase—\\nand sometimes decreased—the productivity and quality metrics of more highly skilled \\nagents. This is because AI assistance helped less-experienced agents communicate using \\ntechniques similar to those of their higher-skilled counterparts.\\n\\nThe following are examples of the operational improvements generative AI can have for \\nspecific use cases:\\n\\n — Customer self-service. Generative AI–fueled chatbots can give immediate and \\n\\npersonalized responses to complex customer inquiries regardless of the language or \\nlocation of the customer. By improving the quality and effectiveness of interactions via \\nautomated channels, generative AI could automate responses to a higher percentage of \\ncustomer inquiries, enabling customer care teams to take on inquiries that can only be \\nresolved by a human agent. Our research found that roughly half of customer contacts \\nmade by banking, telecommunications, and utilities companies in North America are \\nalready handled by machines, including but not exclusively AI. We estimate that generative \\nAI could further reduce the volume of human-serviced contacts by up to 50 percent, \\ndepending on a company’s existing level of automation. \\n\\n — Resolution during initial contact. Generative AI can instantly retrieve data a company \\n\\nhas on a specific customer, which can help a human customer service representative more \\nsuccessfully answer questions and resolve issues during an initial interaction.\\n\\n — Reduced response time. Generative AI can cut the time a human sales representative \\n\\nspends responding to a customer by providing assistance in real time and recommending \\nnext steps. \\n\\n — Increased sales. Because of its ability to rapidly process data on customers and their \\nbrowsing histories, the technology can identify product suggestions and deals tailored \\nto customer preferences. Additionally, generative AI can enhance quality assurance and \\ncoaching by gathering insights from customer conversations, determining what could be \\ndone better, and coaching agents. \\n\\nWe estimate that applying generative AI to customer care functions could increase \\nproductivity at a value ranging from 30 to 45 percent of current function costs.\\n\\nOur analysis captures only the direct impact generative AI might have on the productivity of \\ncustomer operations. It does not account for potential knock-on effects the technology may \\nhave on customer satisfaction and retention arising from an improved experience, including \\nbetter understanding of the customer’s context that can assist human agents in providing \\nmore personalized help and recommendations. \\n\\nThe economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier\\n\\n15\\n\\n\\x0cHow marketing and sales \\ncould be transformed\\n\\nStrategization\\n\\nSales and marketing professionals efficiently \\ngather market trends and customer information \\nfrom unstructured data sources (for example, \\nsocial media, news, research, product information, \\nand customer feedback) and draft effective \\nmarketing and sales communications. \\n\\nAwareness\\n\\nCustomers see campaigns tailored \\nto their segment, language, and \\ndemographic.\\n\\nConsideration\\n\\nCustomers can access comprehensive information, \\ncomparisons, and dynamic recommendations, such as \\npersonal “try ons.” \\n\\n16\\n\\nThe economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier\\n\\n\\x0cConversion\\n\\nVirtual sales representatives enabled by generative \\nAI emulate humanlike qualities—such as empathy, \\npersonalized communication, and natural language \\nprocessing—to build trust and rapport with \\ncustomers. \\n\\nRetention\\n\\nCustomers are more likely to be retained with \\ncustomized messages and rewards, and they can \\ninteract with AI-powered customer-support chatbots \\nthat manage the relationship proactively, with fewer \\nescalations to human agents. \\n\\nMarketing and sales\\nGenerative AI has taken hold rapidly in marketing and sales functions, in which text-based \\ncommunications and personalization at scale are driving forces. The technology can create \\npersonalized messages tailored to individual customer interests, preferences, and behaviors, \\nas well as do tasks such as producing first drafts of brand advertising, headlines, slogans, \\nsocial media posts, and product descriptions.\\n\\nHowever, introducing generative AI to marketing functions requires careful consideration. \\nFor one thing, mathematical models trained on publicly available data without sufficient \\nsafeguards against plagiarism, copyright violations, and branding recognition risks \\ninfringing on intellectual property rights. A virtual try-on application may produce biased \\nrepresentations of certain demographics because of limited or biased training data. Thus, \\nsignificant human oversight is required for conceptual and strategic thinking specific to each \\ncompany’s needs. \\n\\nThe economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier\\n\\n17\\n\\n\\x0cPotential operational benefits from using generative AI for marketing include the following: \\n\\n — Efficient and effective content creation. Generative AI could significantly reduce the \\n\\ntime required for ideation and content drafting, saving valuable time and effort. It can also \\nfacilitate consistency across different pieces of content, ensuring a uniform brand voice, \\nwriting style, and format. Team members can collaborate via generative AI, which can \\nintegrate their ideas into a single cohesive piece. This would allow teams to significantly \\nenhance personalization of marketing messages aimed at different customer segments, \\ngeographies, and demographics. Mass email campaigns can be instantly translated into \\nas many languages as needed, with different imagery and messaging depending on the \\naudience. Generative AI’s ability to produce content with varying specifications could \\nincrease customer value, attraction, conversion, and retention over a lifetime and at a \\nscale beyond what is currently possible through traditional techniques.\\n\\n — Enhanced use of data. Generative AI could help marketing functions overcome the \\nchallenges of unstructured, inconsistent, and disconnected data—for example, from \\ndifferent databases—by interpreting abstract data sources such as text, image, and \\nvarying structures. It can help marketers better use data such as territory performance, \\nsynthesized customer feedback, and customer behavior to generate data-informed \\nmarketing strategies such as targeted customer profiles and channel recommendations. \\nSuch tools could identify and synthesize trends, key drivers, and market and product \\nopportunities from unstructured data such as social media, news, academic research, and \\ncustomer feedback.\\n\\n — SEO optimization. Generative AI can help marketers achieve higher conversion and \\n\\nlower cost through search engine optimization (SEO) for marketing and sales technical \\ncomponents such as page titles, image tags, and URLs. It can synthesize key SEO tokens, \\nsupport specialists in SEO digital content creation, and distribute targeted content to \\ncustomers.\\n\\n — Product discovery and search personalization. With generative AI, product discovery \\n\\nand search can be personalized with multimodal inputs from text, images and speech, and \\ndeep understanding of customer profiles. For example, technology can leverage individual \\nuser preferences, behavior, and purchase history to help customers discover the most \\nrelevant products and generate personalized product descriptions. This would allow CPG, \\ntravel, and retail companies to improve their ecommerce sales by achieving higher website \\nconversion rates. \\n\\nWe estimate that generative AI could increase the productivity of the marketing function with \\na value between 5 and 15 percent of total marketing spending.\\n\\nOur analysis of the potential use of generative AI in marketing doesn’t account for knock-on \\neffects beyond the direct impacts on productivity. Generative AI–enabled synthesis could \\nprovide higher-quality data insights, leading to new ideas for marketing campaigns and \\nbetter-targeted customer segments. Marketing functions could shift resources to producing \\nhigher-quality content for owned channels, potentially reducing spending on external \\nchannels and agencies.\\n\\n18\\n\\nThe economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier\\n\\n\\x0cGenerative AI could also change the way both B2B and B2C companies approach sales. The \\nfollowing are two use cases for sales:\\n\\n — Increase probability of sale. Generative AI could identify and prioritize sales leads \\n\\nby creating comprehensive consumer profiles from structured and unstructured data \\nand suggesting actions to staff to improve client engagement at every point of contact. \\nFor example, generative AI could provide better information about client preferences, \\npotentially improving close rates. \\n\\n — Improve lead development. Generative AI could help sales representatives nurture leads \\nby synthesizing relevant product sales information and customer profiles and creating \\ndiscussion scripts to facilitate customer conversation, including up- and cross-selling \\ntalking points. It could also automate sales follow-ups and passively nurture leads until \\nclients are ready for direct interaction with a human sales agent.\\n\\nOur analysis suggests that implementing generative AI could increase sales productivity by \\napproximately 3 to 5 percent of current global sales expenditures.\\n\\nThis analysis may not fully account for additional revenue that generative AI could bring \\nto sales functions. For instance, generative AI’s ability to identify leads and follow-up \\ncapabilities could uncover new leads and facilitate more effective outreach that would bring \\nin additional revenue. Also, the time saved by sales representatives due to generative AI’s \\ncapabilities could be invested in higher-quality customer interactions, resulting in increased \\nsales success.\\n\\nGenerative AI as a virtual collaborator\\nIn other cases, generative AI can drive value by working in partnership with workers, \\naugmenting their work in ways that accelerate their productivity. Its ability to rapidly digest \\nmountains of data and draw conclusions from it enables the technology to offer insights and \\noptions that can dramatically enhance knowledge work. This can significantly speed up the \\nprocess of developing a product and allow employees to devote more time to higher-impact \\ntasks. \\n\\nGenerative AI could increase \\nsales productivity by 3 to \\n5 percent of current global \\nsales expenditures.\\n\\nThe economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier\\n\\n19\\n\\n\\x0cHow software engineering \\ncould be transformed\\n\\nInception and planning\\n\\nSoftware engineers and product managers use \\ngenerative AI to assist in analyzing, cleaning, and labeling \\nlarge volumes of data, such as user feedback, market \\ntrends, and existing system logs.\\n\\nSystem design\\n\\nEngineers use generative AI to create multiple IT \\narchitecture designs and iterate on the potential \\nconfigurations, accelerating system design, and \\nallowing faster time to market.\\n\\nCoding\\n\\nEngineers are assisted by AI tools that can code, \\nreducing development time by assisting with drafts, \\nrapidly finding prompts, and serving as an easily \\nnavigable knowledge base. \\n\\nTesting\\n\\nEngineers employ algorithms that can enhance \\nfunctional and performance testing to ensure \\nquality and can generate test cases and test data \\nautomatically.\\n\\n20\\n\\nThe economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier\\n\\n\\x0cMaintenance\\n\\nEngineers use AI insights on system logs, user feedback, \\nand performance data to help diagnose issues, \\nsuggest fixes, and predict other high-priority areas of \\nimprovement. \\n\\nSoftware engineering\\nTreating computer languages as just another language opens new possibilities for software \\nengineering. Software engineers can use generative AI in pair programming and to do \\naugmented coding and train LLMs to develop applications that generate code when given a \\nnatural-language prompt describing what that code should do.\\n\\nSoftware engineering is a significant function in most companies, and it continues to grow \\nas all large companies, not just tech titans, embed software in a wide array of products and \\nservices. For example, much of the value of new vehicles comes from digital features such as \\nadaptive cruise control, parking assistance, and IoT connectivity.\\n\\nAccording to our analysis, the direct impact of AI on the productivity of software engineering \\ncould range from 20 to 45 percent of current annual spending on the function. This value \\nwould arise primarily from reducing time spent on certain activities, such as generating initial \\ncode drafts, code correction and refactoring, root-cause analysis, and generating new system \\ndesigns. By accelerating the coding process, generative AI could push the skill sets and \\ncapabilities needed in software engineering toward code and architecture design. One study \\nfound that software developers using Microsoft’s GitHub Copilot completed tasks 56 percent \\nfaster than those not using the tool.9 An internal McKinsey empirical study of software \\nengineering teams found those who were trained to use generative AI tools rapidly reduced \\nthe time needed to generate and refactor code—and engineers also reported a better work \\nexperience, citing improvements in happiness, flow, and fulfillment. \\n\\nOur analysis did not account for the increase in application quality and the resulting boost in \\nproductivity that generative AI could bring by improving code or enhancing IT architecture—\\nwhich can improve productivity across the IT value chain. However, the quality of IT \\narchitecture still largely depends on software architects, rather than on initial drafts that \\ngenerative AI’s current capabilities allow it to produce.\\n\\nLarge technology companies are already selling generative AI for software engineering, \\nincluding GitHub Copilot, which is now integrated with OpenAI’s GPT-4, and Replit, used by \\nmore than 20 million coders.10\\n\\nThe economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier\\n\\n21\\n\\n\\x0cHow product R&D \\ncould be transformed\\n\\nEarly research analysis\\n\\nResearchers use generative AI to enhance market reporting, \\nideation, and product or solution drafting. \\n\\nVirtual design\\n\\nResearchers use generative AI to generate \\nprompt-based drafts and designs, allowing them \\nto iterate quickly with more design options. \\n\\nVirtual simulations\\n\\nResearchers accelerate and optimize the \\nvirtual simulation phase if combined with new \\ndeep learning generative design techniques. \\n\\nPhysical test planning\\n\\nResearchers optimize test cases for more \\nefficient testing, reducing the time required \\nfor physical build and testing.\\n\\nProduct R&D\\nGenerative AI’s potential in R&D is perhaps less well recognized than its potential in other \\nbusiness functions. Still, our research indicates the technology could deliver productivity with \\na value ranging from 10 to 15 percent of overall R&D costs.\\n\\nFor example, the life sciences and chemical industries have begun using generative AI \\nfoundation models in their R&D for what is known as generative design. Foundation models \\ncan generate candidate molecules, accelerating the process of developing new drugs and \\nmaterials. Entos, a biotech pharmaceutical company, has paired generative AI with automated \\nsynthetic development tools to design small-molecule therapeutics. But the same principles \\ncan be applied to the design of many other products, including larger-scale physical products \\nand electrical circuits, among others. \\n\\n22\\n\\nThe economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier\\n\\n\\x0cWhile other generative design techniques have already unlocked some of the potential to apply \\nAI in R&D, their cost and data requirements, such as the use of “traditional” machine learning, \\ncan limit their application. Pretrained foundation models that underpin generative AI, or models \\nthat have been enhanced with fine-tuning, have much broader areas of application than models \\noptimized for a single task. They can therefore accelerate time to market and broaden the types \\nof products to which generative design can be applied. For now, however, foundation models \\nlack the capabilities to help design products across all industries.\\n\\nIn addition to the productivity gains that result from being able to quickly produce candidate \\ndesigns, generative design can also enable improvements in the designs themselves, as in the \\nfollowing examples of the operational improvements generative AI could bring: \\n\\n — Enhanced design. Generative AI can help product designers reduce costs by selecting and \\nusing materials more efficiently. It can also optimize designs for manufacturing, which can \\nlead to cost reductions in logistics and production. \\n\\n — Improved product testing and quality. Using generative AI in generative design can \\n\\nproduce a higher-quality product, resulting in increased attractiveness and market appeal. \\nGenerative AI can help to reduce testing time of complex systems and accelerate trial \\nphases involving customer testing through its ability to draft scenarios and profile testing \\ncandidates. \\n\\nWe also identified a new R&D use case for nongenerative AI: deep learning surrogates, the use \\nof which has grown since our earlier research, can be paired with generative AI to produce even \\ngreater benefits (see Box 2, “Deep learning surrogates”). To be sure, integration will require the \\ndevelopment of specific solutions, but the value could be significant because deep learning \\nsurrogates have the potential to accelerate the testing of designs proposed by generative AI. \\n\\nWhile we have estimated the potential direct impacts of generative AI on the R&D function, \\nwe did not attempt to estimate the technology’s potential to create entirely novel product \\ncategories. These are the types of innovations that can produce step changes not only in the \\nperformance of individual companies but in economic growth overall.\\n\\nBox 2\\nDeep learning surrogates\\n\\nProduct design in industries producing \\nphysical products often involves physics-\\nbased virtual simulations such as \\ncomputational fluid dynamics (CFD) and \\nfinite element analysis (FEA). Although \\nthey are faster than actual physical \\ntesting, these techniques can be time- \\nand resource-intensive, especially for \\ndesigning complex parts—running CFD \\nsimulations on graphics processing units \\n\\ncan take hours. And these techniques \\nare even more complex and compute-\\nintensive when they involve simulations \\ncoupled across multiple disciplines (for \\nexample, physical stress and temperature \\ndistribution), which is sometimes called \\nmultiphysics.\\n\\nDeep learning applications are now \\nrevolutionizing the virtual testing phase of \\n\\nthe R&D process by using deep learning \\nmodels to emulate (multi)physics-\\nbased simulations at higher speeds and \\nlower costs. Instead of taking hours \\nto run physics-based models, these \\ndeep learning surrogates can produce \\nthe results of simulations in just a few \\nseconds, allowing researchers to test \\nmany more designs and enabling faster \\ndecision making on products and designs.\\n\\nThe economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier\\n\\n23\\n\\n\\x0cValue potential by modality\\n\\nTechnology has revolutionized the way we conduct business, and text-based AI is on the \\nfrontier of this change. Indeed, text-based data is plentiful, accessible, and easily processed \\nand analyzed at large scale by LLMs, which has prompted a strong emphasis on them in the \\ninitial stages of generative AI development. The current investment landscape in generative \\nAI is also heavily focused on text-based applications such as chatbots, virtual assistants, and \\nlanguage translation. However, we estimate that almost one-fifth of the value that generative \\nAI can unlock across our use cases would take advantage of multimodal capabilities beyond \\ntext to text.\\n\\nWhile most of generative AI’s initial traction has been in text-based use cases, recent \\nadvances in generative AI have also led to breakthroughs in image generation, as OpenAI’s \\nDALL·E and Stable Diffusion have so amply illustrated, and much progress is being made in \\naudio, including voice and music, and video. These capabilities have obvious applications \\nin marketing for generating advertising materials and other marketing content, and these \\ntechnologies are already being applied in media industries, including game design. Indeed, \\nsome of these examples challenge existing business models around talent, monetization, and \\nintellectual property.11\\n\\nThe multimodal capabilities of generative AI could also be used effectively in R&D. Generative \\nAI systems could create first drafts of circuit designs, architectural drawings, structural \\nengineering designs, and thermal designs based on prompts that describe requirements for \\na product. Achieving this will require training foundation models in these domains (think of \\nLLMs trained on “design languages”). Once trained, such foundation models could increase \\nproductivity on a similar magnitude to software development.\\n\\nValue potential by industry\\n\\nAcross the 63 use cases we analyzed, generative AI has the potential to generate $2.6 trillion \\nto $4.4 trillion in value across industries. Its precise impact will depend on a variety of factors, \\nsuch as the mix and importance of different functions, as well as the scale of an industry’s \\nrevenue (Exhibit 4). \\n\\nAcross 63 use cases, \\ngenerative AI has the \\npotential to generate \\n$2.6 trillion to $4.4 trillion \\nin value across industries.\\n\\n24\\n\\nThe economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier\\n\\n\\x0cExhibit 4\\n\\nGenerative AI use cases will have different impacts on business functions \\nacross industries.\\n\\nGenerative AI productivity \\nimpact by business functions¹ \\n\\nM\\n\\na\\nr\\nk\\n\\nC\\n\\nu\\n\\ns\\nt\\no\\n\\nLow impact\\n\\nHigh impact\\n\\ne\\n\\ntin\\n\\nS\\n\\nu\\n\\np\\n\\nply c\\n\\nh\\n\\nS\\n\\no\\n\\nft\\n\\nw\\n\\nS\\n\\ntr\\na\\nt\\ne\\n\\nT\\n\\nale\\n\\nn\\n\\nt a\\n\\nn\\n\\nP\\nr\\no\\n\\ng\\n\\n a\\n\\nn\\n\\nm\\n\\nd\\n\\ne\\n\\nr o\\n\\np\\n\\nu\\n\\nc\\n\\nt a\\n\\nd\\n\\n s\\n\\nale\\n\\ns\\n\\nn\\n\\nd\\n\\ne\\nr\\na\\n\\ntio\\n\\nn\\n\\ns\\n\\nain a\\n\\nn\\n\\na\\nr\\ne e\\n\\nn\\n\\ngin\\n\\ne\\n\\nR\\n\\n&\\n\\ne\\n\\nrin\\n\\nD\\n\\ng\\n\\nd\\n\\n o\\n\\np\\n\\nR\\n\\nis\\n\\nk a\\n\\ng\\n\\ny a\\n\\nn\\n\\nd\\n\\n fi\\n\\nC\\n\\no\\nr\\np\\n\\nd\\n\\n o\\nr\\ng\\n\\na\\n\\ne\\nr\\na\\n\\ntio\\n\\nn\\n\\nd\\n\\n le\\n\\nn\\n\\ns\\n\\ng\\n\\nal\\n\\no\\nr\\na\\nt\\ne I\\n\\nn\\n\\na\\n\\nn\\n\\nc\\n\\ne\\n\\nT\\n\\n2\\n\\nniz\\n\\na\\n\\ntio\\n\\nn\\n\\nTotal, % of\\nindustry\\nrevenue\\n\\nTotal,\\n$ billion\\n\\n760–\\n1,200\\n\\n340–\\n470 \\n\\n230–\\n420 \\n\\n580–\\n1,200 \\n\\n280–\\n530 \\n\\n180–\\n260 \\n\\n120–\\n260 \\n\\n40–\\n50 \\n\\n60–\\n90 \\n\\nAdministrative and \\nprofessional services\\nAdvanced electronics \\nand semiconductors\\n\\n0.9–1.4\\n\\n150–250\\n\\n1.3–2.3\\n\\n100–170\\n\\nAdvanced manufacturing3\\n\\n1.4–2.4\\n\\n170–290\\n\\nAgriculture\\n\\nBanking\\n\\n0.6–1.0\\n\\n40–70\\n\\n2.8–4.7\\n\\n200–340\\n\\nBasic materials\\n\\n0.7– 1.2\\n\\n120–200\\n\\nChemical\\n\\nConstruction\\n\\n0.8–1.3\\n\\n80–140\\n\\n0.7–1.2\\n\\n90–150\\n\\nConsumer packaged goods\\n\\n1.4–2.3\\n\\n160–270\\n\\nEducation\\n\\nEnergy\\n\\nHealthcare\\n\\nHigh tech\\n\\nInsurance\\n\\n2.2–4.0\\n\\n120–230\\n\\n1.0– 1.6\\n\\n150–240\\n\\n1.8–3.2\\n\\n150–260\\n\\n4.8–9.3\\n\\n240–460\\n\\n1.8– 2.8\\n\\n50–70\\n\\nMedia and entertainment\\n\\n1.5– 2.6\\n\\n60–110\\n\\nPharmaceuticals and \\nmedical products\\n\\n2.6–4.5\\n\\n60–110\\n\\nPublic and social sector\\n\\n0.5–0.9\\n\\n70–110\\n\\nReal estate\\n\\nRetail4\\n\\n1.0–1.7\\n\\n110–180\\n\\n1.2–1.9\\n\\n240–390\\n\\nTelecommunications\\n\\n2.3–3.7\\n\\n60–100\\n\\nTravel, transport, and logistics\\n\\n1.2–2.0\\n\\n180–300\\n\\n2,600–4,400\\n\\nNote: Figures may not sum to 100%, because of rounding.\\n1Excludes implementation costs (eg, training, licenses).\\n2Excluding software engineering.\\n3Includes aerospace, defense, and auto manufacturing.\\n4Including auto retail.\\nSource: Comparative Industry Service (CIS), IHS Markit; Oxford Economics; McKinsey Corporate and Business Functions database; McKinsey Manufacturing \\nand Supply Chain 360; McKinsey Sales Navigator; Ignite, a McKinsey database; McKinsey analysis \\n\\nMcKinsey & Company\\n\\nThe economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier\\n\\n25\\n\\n \\n\\x0cFor example, our analysis estimates generative AI could contribute roughly $310 billion in \\nadditional value for the retail industry (including auto dealerships) by boosting performance in \\nfunctions such as marketing and customer interactions.

In the life \\nsciences industry, generative AI is poised to make significant contributions to drug discovery \\nand development.\\n\\nWe share our detailed analysis of these industries in the following industry spotlights. \\n\\n26\\n\\nThe economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier\\n\\n\\x0cSpotlight: Retail and CPG\\n\\nGenerative AI could change the game for retail \\nand consumer packaged goods companies\\n\\nThe technology could generate value for \\nthe retail and consumer packaged goods \\n(CPG) industry by increasing productivity \\nby 1.2 to 2.0 percent of annual revenues, \\nor an additional $400 billion to $660 bil-\\nlion.1 To streamline processes, generative \\nAI could automate key functions such as \\ncustomer service, marketing and sales, \\nand inventory and supply chain manage-\\nment. \\n\\nTechnology has played an essen-\\ntial role in the retail and CPG indus-\\ntries for decades. Traditional AI and \\nadvanced-analytics solutions have \\nhelped companies manage vast pools \\nof data across large numbers of SKUs, \\nexpansive supply chain and warehousing \\nnetworks, and complex product catego-\\nries such as consumables. \\n\\nIn addition, the industries are heavily \\ncustomer facing, which offers opportu-\\nnities for generative AI to complement \\npreviously existing artificial intelli-\\ngence. For example, generative AI’s \\nability to personalize offerings could \\noptimize marketing and sales activities \\nalready handled by existing AI solutions. \\nSimilarly, generative AI tools excel at data \\nmanagement and could support existing \\nAI-driven pricing tools. Applying gener-\\native AI to such activities could be a step \\ntoward integrating applications across a \\nfull enterprise.\\n\\nGenerative AI is already at work in some \\nretail and CPG companies:\\n\\nReinvention of the customer \\ninteraction pattern\\nConsumers increasingly seek customiza-\\ntion in everything from clothing and cos-\\nmetics to curated shopping experiences, \\npersonalized outreach, and food—and \\ngenerative AI can improve that expe-\\nrience. Generative AI can aggregate \\nmarket data to test concepts, ideas, and \\nmodels. Stitch Fix, which uses algorithms \\nto suggest style choices to its custom-\\ners, has experimented with DALL·E to \\nvisualize products based on customer \\npreferences regarding color, fabric, and \\n\\nstyle. Using text-to-image generation, \\nthe company’s stylists can visualize an \\narticle of clothing based on a consumer’s \\npreferences and then identify a similar \\narticle among Stitch Fix’s inventory. \\n\\nRetailers can create applications that \\ngive shoppers a next-generation experi-\\nence, creating a significant competitive \\nadvantage in an era when customers \\nexpect to have a single natural-language \\ninterface help them select products. For \\nexample, generative AI can improve the \\nprocess of choosing and ordering ingre-\\ndients for a meal or preparing food—\\nimagine a chatbot that could pull up the \\nmost popular tips from the comments \\nattached to a recipe. There is also a big \\nopportunity to enhance customer value \\nmanagement by delivering personalized \\nmarketing campaigns through a chatbot. \\nSuch applications can have human-like \\nconversations about products in ways \\nthat can increase customer satisfaction, \\ntraffic, and brand loyalty. Generative \\nAI offers retailers and CPG companies \\nmany opportunities to cross-sell and \\nupsell, collect insights to improve prod-\\nuct offerings, and increase their cus-\\ntomer base, revenue opportunities, and \\noverall marketing ROI.\\n\\nAccelerating the creation \\nof value in key areas \\nGenerative AI tools can facilitate copy \\nwriting for marketing and sales, help \\nbrainstorm creative marketing ideas, \\nexpedite consumer research, and accel-\\nerate content analysis and creation. The \\npotential improvement in writing and \\nvisuals can increase awareness and \\nimprove sales conversion rates.\\n\\nRapid resolution and enhanced \\ninsights in customer care\\nThe growth of e-commerce also elevates \\nthe importance of effective consumer \\ninteractions. Retailers can combine \\nexisting AI tools with generative AI to \\nenhance the capabilities of chatbots, \\nenabling them to better mimic the \\ninteraction style of human agents—for \\n\\nexample, by responding directly to a \\ncustomer’s query, tracking or cancel-\\ning an order, offering discounts, and \\nupselling. Automating repetitive tasks \\nallows human agents to devote more \\ntime to handling complicated customer \\nproblems and obtaining contextual infor-\\nmation.\\n\\nDisruptive and creative innovation\\nGenerative AI tools can enhance the \\nprocess of developing new versions \\nof products by digitally creating new \\ndesigns rapidly. A designer can generate \\npackaging designs from scratch or gen-\\nerate variations on an existing design. \\nThis technology is developing rapidly and \\nhas the potential to add text-to-video \\ngeneration. \\n\\nAdditional factors to consider\\nAs retail and CPG executives explore \\nhow to integrate generative AI in their \\noperations, they should keep in mind \\nseveral factors that could affect their \\nability to capture value from the technol-\\nogy. \\n\\nExternal inference. Generative AI has \\nincreased the need to understand \\nwhether generated content is based on \\nfact or inference, requiring a new level of \\nquality control.\\n\\nAdversarial attacks. Foundation models \\nare a prime target for attack by hackers \\nand other bad actors, increasing the vari-\\nety of potential security vulnerabilities \\nand privacy risks.\\n\\nTo address these concerns, retail and \\nCPG companies will need to strate-\\ngically keep humans in the loop and \\nensure security and privacy are top \\nconsiderations for any implementation. \\nCompanies will need to institute new \\nquality checks for processes previous-\\nly handled by humans, such as emails \\nwritten by customer reps, and per-\\nform more-detailed quality checks on \\nAI-assisted processes such as product \\ndesign.\\n\\n1  Vehicular retail is included as part of our overall retail analysis.\\n\\nThe economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier\\n\\n27\\n\\n\\x0cSpotlight: Banking\\n\\nBanks could realize substantial \\nvalue from generative AI \\n\\nGenerative AI could have a significant \\nimpact on the banking industry,  gener-\\nating value from increased productivity \\nof 2.8 to 4.7 percent of the industry’s \\nannual revenues, or an additional $200 \\nbillion to $340 billion. On top of that \\nimpact, the use of generative AI tools \\ncould also enhance customer satis-\\nfaction, improve decision making and \\nemployee experience, and decrease \\nrisks through better monitoring of fraud \\nand risk. \\n\\nBanking, a knowledge and technolo-\\ngy-enabled industry, has already bene-\\nfited significantly from previously exist-\\ning applications of artificial intelligence \\nin areas such as marketing and custom-\\ner operations.1 Generative AI applica-\\ntions could deliver additional benefits, \\nespecially because text modalities are \\nprevalent in areas such as regulations \\nand programming language, and the \\nindustry is customer facing, with many \\nB2C and small-business customers.2 \\n\\nSeveral characteristics position the \\nindustry for the integration of genera-\\ntive AI applications:\\n\\n — Sustained digitization efforts along \\nwith legacy IT systems. Banks \\nhave been investing in technology \\nfor decades, accumulating a \\nsignificant amount of technical debt \\nalong with a siloed and complex IT \\narchitecture.3\\n\\n — Large customer-facing workforces. \\nBanking relies on a large number \\nof service representatives such \\nas call-center agents and wealth \\nmanagement financial advisers. \\n\\n — A stringent regulatory environment. \\nAs a heavily regulated industry, \\n\\nbanking has a substantial number of \\nrisk, compliance, and legal needs.\\n\\n — White-collar industry. Generative \\n\\nAI’s impact could span the \\norganization, assisting all \\nemployees in writing emails, \\ncreating business presentations, \\nand other tasks.\\n\\nOn the move\\n\\nBanks have started to grasp the poten-\\ntial of generative AI in their front lines \\nand in their software activities. Early \\nadopters are harnessing solutions such \\nas ChatGPT as well as industry-specific \\nsolutions, primarily for software and \\nknowledge applications. Three uses \\ndemonstrate its value potential to the \\nindustry:\\n\\nA virtual expert to augment \\nemployee performance\\nA generative AI bot trained on pro-\\nprietary knowledge such as policies, \\nresearch, and customer interaction \\ncould provide always-on, deep techni-\\ncal support. Today, frontline spending \\nis dedicated mostly to validating offers \\nand interacting with clients, but giv-\\ning frontline workers access to data \\nas well could improve the customer \\nexperience. The technology could also \\nmonitor industries and clients and \\nsend alerts on semantic queries from \\npublic sources. For example, Morgan \\nStanley is building an AI assistant using \\nGPT-4, with the aim of helping tens of \\nthousands of wealth managers quickly \\nfind and synthesize answers from a \\nmassive internal knowledge base.4 The \\nmodel combines search and content \\ncreation so wealth managers can find \\nand tailor information for any client at \\nany moment.\\n\\nOne European bank has leveraged gen-\\nerative AI to develop an environmental, \\nsocial, and governance (ESG) virtual \\nexpert by synthesizing and extracting \\nfrom long documents with unstruc-\\ntured information. The model answers \\ncomplex questions based on a prompt, \\nidentifying the source of each answer \\nand extracting information from pic-\\ntures and tables.\\n\\nGenerative AI could reduce the signifi-\\ncant costs associated with back-office \\noperations. Such customer-facing \\nchatbots could assess user requests \\nand select the best service expert to \\naddress them based on characteristics \\nsuch as topic, level of difficulty, and \\ntype of customer. Through generative \\nAI assistants, service professionals \\ncould rapidly access all relevant infor-\\nmation such as product guides and \\npolicies to instantaneously address \\ncustomer requests. \\n\\nCode acceleration to reduce tech \\ndebt and deliver software faster\\nGenerative AI tools are useful for soft-\\nware development in four broad cate-\\ngories. First, they can draft code based \\non context via input code or natural \\nlanguage, helping developers code \\nmore quickly and with reduced friction \\nwhile enabling automatic translations \\nand no- and low-code tools. Second, \\nsuch tools can automatically generate, \\nprioritize, run, and review different \\ncode tests, accelerating testing and \\nincreasing coverage and effectiveness. \\nThird, generative AI’s natural-language \\ntranslation capabilities can optimize \\nthe integration and migration of legacy \\nframeworks. Last, the tools can review \\ncode to identify defects and inefficien-\\ncies in computing.

In addition, generative \\nAI could automatically produce model \\ndocumentation, identify missing docu-\\nmentation, and scan relevant regulatory \\nupdates to create alerts for relevant \\nshifts. \\n\\nFactors for banks to consider\\n\\nWhen exploring how to integrate gen-\\nerative AI into operations, banks can be \\nmindful of a number of factors: \\n\\n — The level of regulation for different \\n\\nprocesses. These vary from \\nunregulated processes such \\nas customer service to heavily \\nregulated processes such as credit \\nrisk scoring.\\n\\n — Type of end user. End users vary \\nwidely in their expectations and \\nfamiliarity with generative AI—for \\n\\nexample, employees compared with \\nhigh-net-worth clients.\\n\\n — Intended level of work automation. \\nAI agents integrated through APIs \\ncould act nearly autonomously \\nor as copilots, giving real-time \\nsuggestions to agents during \\ncustomer interactions.\\n\\n — Data constraints. While public data \\nsuch as annual reports could be \\nmade widely available, there would \\nneed to be limits on identifiable \\ndetails for customers and other \\ninternal data. \\n\\nA generative AI bot trained \\non proprietary knowledge \\nsuch as policies, research, \\nand customer interaction \\ncould provide always-on, \\ndeep technical support.\\n\\nThe economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier\\n\\n29\\n\\n\\x0cSpotlight: Pharmaceuticals and medical products\\n\\nGenerative AI deployment could unlock \\npotential value equal to 2.6 to 4.5 percent of \\nannual revenues across the pharmaceutical \\nand medical-product industries\\n\\nOur analysis finds that generative AI \\ncould have a significant impact on the \\npharmaceutical and medical-product \\nindustries—from $60 billion to $110 bil-\\nlion annually. This big potential reflects \\nthe resource-intensive process of dis-\\ncovering new drug compounds. Pharma \\ncompanies typically spend approximate-\\nly 20 percent of revenues on R&D,1 and \\nthe development of a new drug takes an \\naverage of ten to 15 years. \\n\\nWith this level of spending and time-\\nline, improving the speed and quality \\nof R&D can generate substantial value. \\nFor example, lead identification—a \\nstep in the drug discovery process in \\nwhich researchers identify a molecule \\nthat would best address the target for \\na potential new drug—can take several \\nmonths even with “traditional” deep \\nlearning techniques. Foundation models \\nand generative AI can enable organiza-\\ntions to complete this step in a matter of \\nweeks. \\n\\nGenerative AI use cases \\naligned to industry needs\\nDrug discovery involves narrowing the \\nuniverse of possible compounds to those \\nthat could effectively treat specific con-\\nditions. Generative AI’s ability to process \\nmassive amounts of data and model \\noptions can accelerate output across \\nseveral use cases: \\n\\nImprove automation of \\npreliminary screening\\nIn the lead identification stage of drug \\ndevelopment, scientists can use founda-\\ntion models to automate the preliminary \\nscreening of chemicals in the search for \\nthose that will produce specific effects \\non drug targets. To start, thousands of \\ncell cultures are tested and paired with \\nimages of the corresponding experi-\\n\\nment. Using an off-the-shelf foundation \\nmodel, researchers can cluster similar \\nimages more precisely than they can \\nwith traditional models, enabling them to \\nselect the most promising chemicals for \\nfurther analysis during lead optimization. \\n\\nEnhance indication finding\\nAn important phase of drug discovery \\ninvolves the identification and prioriti-\\nzation of new indications—that is, dis-\\neases, symptoms, or circumstances that \\njustify the use of a specific medication \\nor other treatment, such as a test, pro-\\ncedure, or surgery. Possible indications \\nfor a given drug are based on a patient \\ngroup’s clinical history and medical \\nrecords, and they are then prioritized \\nbased on their similarities to established \\nand evidence-backed indications. \\n\\nResearchers start by mapping the \\npatient cohort’s clinical events and \\nmedical histories—including potential \\ndiagnoses, prescribed medications, \\nand performed procedures—from real-\\nworld data. Using foundation models, \\nresearchers can quantify clinical events, \\nestablish relationships, and measure the \\nsimilarity between the patient cohort \\nand evidence-backed indications. The \\nresult is a short list of indications that \\nhave a better probability of success in \\nclinical trials because they can be more \\naccurately matched to appropriate \\npatient groups.\\n\\nPharma companies that have used this \\napproach have reported high success \\nrates in clinical trials for the top five indi-\\ncations recommended by a foundation \\nmodel for a tested drug. This success \\nhas allowed these drugs to progress \\nsmoothly into Phase 3 trials, significantly \\naccelerating the drug development pro-\\ncess. \\n\\n1  Research and development in the pharmaceutical industry, Congressional Budget Office, April 2021.\\n\\n30\\n\\nThe economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier\\n\\nAdditional factors to consider\\nBefore integrating generative AI into \\noperations, pharma executives should \\nbe aware of some factors that could limit \\ntheir ability to capture its benefits:\\n\\n — The need for a human in the loop. \\n\\nCompanies may need to implement \\nnew quality checks on processes \\nthat shift from humans to generative \\nAI, such as representative-generated \\nemails, or more detailed quality \\nchecks on AI-assisted processes, \\nsuch as drug discovery. The \\nincreasing need to verify whether \\ngenerated content is based on fact \\nor inference elevates the need for a \\nnew level of quality control.\\n\\n — Explainability. A lack of transparency \\ninto the origins of generated content \\nand traceability of root data could \\nmake it difficult to update models \\nand scan them for potential risks; \\nfor instance, a generative AI solution \\nfor synthesizing scientific literature \\nmay not be able to point to the \\nspecific articles or quotes that led \\nit to infer that a new treatment is \\nvery popular among physicians. The \\ntechnology can also “hallucinate,” \\nor generate responses that are \\nobviously incorrect or inappropriate \\nfor the context. Systems need to be \\ndesigned to point to specific articles \\nor data sources, and then do human-\\nin-the-loop checking. \\n\\n — Privacy considerations. Generative \\nAI’s use of clinical images and \\nmedical records could increase the \\nrisk that protected health information \\nwill leak, potentially violating \\nregulations that require pharma \\ncompanies to protect patient privacy. \\n\\n\\x0cIn this chapter, we have estimated the organizational value generative AI could deliver \\nthrough use cases across industries and business functions, but the technology’s potential \\nis much greater. As it is embedded into tools used by every knowledge worker, its additional \\nimpact may be more diffuse but no less valuable than that associated with these use cases. \\nCompanies need to find ways to maximize the value created by the generative AI they deploy \\nwhile also taking care to monitor and manage its impact on their workforces and society at \\nlarge. \\n\\nThe economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier\\n\\n31\\n\\n\\x0c3\\n\\nThe generative AI future \\nof work: Impacts on \\nwork activities, economic \\ngrowth, and productivity \\n\\nTechnology has been changing the anatomy of work for decades. Over the years, machines \\nhave given human workers various “superpowers”; for instance, industrial-age machines \\nenabled workers to accomplish physical tasks beyond the capabilities of their own bodies. \\nMore recently, computers have enabled knowledge workers to perform calculations that \\nwould have taken years to do manually. \\n\\nThese examples illustrate how technology can augment work through the automation of \\nindividual activities that workers would have otherwise had to do themselves. At a conceptual \\nlevel, the application of generative AI may follow the same pattern in the modern workplace, \\nalthough as we show later in this chapter, the types of activities that generative AI could \\naffect, and the types of occupations with activities that could change, will likely be different as \\na result of this technology than for older technologies.\\n\\nThe McKinsey Global Institute began analyzing the impact of technological automation \\nof work activities and modeling scenarios of adoption in 2017. At that time, we estimated \\nthat workers spent half of their time on activities that had the potential to be automated by \\n\\n32\\n\\nThe economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier\\n\\n\\x0cadapting technology that existed at that time, or what we call technical automation potential. \\nWe also modeled a range of potential scenarios for the pace at which these technologies \\ncould be adopted and affect work activities throughout the global economy. \\n\\nTechnology adoption at scale does not occur overnight. The potential of technological \\ncapabilities in a lab does not necessarily mean they can be immediately integrated into a \\nsolution that automates a specific work activity—developing such solutions takes time. Even \\nwhen such a solution is developed, it might not be economically feasible to use if its costs \\nexceed those of human labor. Additionally, even if economic incentives for deployment exist, it \\ntakes time for adoption to spread across the global economy. Hence, our adoption scenarios, \\nwhich consider these factors together with the technical automation potential, provide a \\nsense of the pace and scale at which workers’ activities could shift over time.\\n\\nLarge-scale shifts in the mix of work activities and occupations are not unprecedented. \\nConsider the work of a farmer today compared with what a farmer did just a few short years \\nago. Many farmers now access market information on mobile phones to determine when and \\nwhere to sell their crops or download sophisticated modeling of weather patterns. From a \\nmore macro perspective, agricultural employment in China went from an 82 percent share of \\nall workers in 1962 to 13 percent in 2013. Labor markets are also dynamic: millions of people \\nleave their jobs every month in the United States.12 But this does not minimize the challenges \\nfaced by individual workers whose lives are upended by these shifts, or the organizational or \\nsocietal challenges of ensuring that workers have the skills to take on the work that will be in \\ndemand and that their incomes are sufficient to grow their standards of living. \\n\\nAlso, demographics have made such shifts in activities a necessity from a macroeconomic \\nperspective. An economic growth gap has opened as a result of the slowing growth of the \\nworld’s workforce. In some major countries, workforces have shrunk because populations are \\naging. Labor productivity will have to accelerate to achieve economic growth and enhance \\nprosperity.\\n\\nThe analyses in this paper incorporate the potential impact of generative AI on today’s work \\nactivities. The new capabilities of generative AI, combined with previous technologies and \\nintegrated into corporate operations around the world, could accelerate the potential for \\ntechnical automation of individual activities and the adoption of technologies that augment \\nthe capabilities of the workforce. They could also have an impact on knowledge workers \\nwhose activities were not expected to shift as a result of these technologies until later in the \\nfuture (see Box 3, “About the research”). \\n\\nLabor productivity will \\nhave to accelerate to \\nachieve economic growth \\nand enhance prosperity.\\n\\nThe economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier\\n\\n33\\n\\n\\x0cBox 3\\nAbout the research\\n\\nThis analysis builds on the methodology \\nwe established in 2017. We began by \\nexamining the US Bureau of Labor \\nStatistics O*Net breakdown of about \\n850 occupations into roughly 2,100 \\ndetailed work activities. For each of \\nthese activities, we scored the level of \\ncapability necessary to successfully \\nperform the activity against a set of 18 \\ncapabilities that have the potential for \\nautomation (exhibit).\\n\\nWe also surveyed experts in the \\nautomation of each of these capabilities \\nto estimate automation technologies’ \\ncurrent performance level against each \\nof these capabilities, as well as how \\nthe technology’s performance might \\nadvance over time. Specifically, this \\nyear, we updated our assessments of \\ntechnology’s performance in cognitive, \\nlanguage, and social and emotional \\ncapabilities based on a survey of \\ngenerative AI experts. \\n\\nExhibit\\n\\nBased on these assessments of the \\ntechnical automation potential of each \\ndetailed work activity at each point in \\ntime, we modeled potential scenarios for \\nthe adoption of work automation around \\nthe world. First, we estimated a range \\nof time to implement a solution that \\ncould automate each specific detailed \\nwork activity, once all the capability \\nrequirements were met by the state of \\ntechnology development. Second, we \\nestimated a range of potential costs \\nfor this technology when it is first \\nintroduced, and then declining over \\ntime, based on historical precedents. \\nWe modeled the beginning of adoption \\nfor a specific detailed work activity in a \\nparticular occupation in a country (for 47 \\ncountries, accounting for more than 80 \\npercent of the global workforce) when \\nthe cost of the automation technology \\nreaches parity with the cost of human \\nlabor in that occupation.\\n\\nBased on a historical analysis of \\nvarious technologies, we modeled a \\nrange of adoption timelines from eight \\nto 27 years between the beginning \\nof adoption and its plateau, using \\nsigmoidal curves (S-curves). This range \\nimplicitly accounts for the many factors \\nthat could affect the pace at which \\nadoption occurs, including regulation, \\nlevels of investment, and management \\ndecision making within firms.\\n\\nThe modeled scenarios create a \\ntime range for the potential pace of \\nautomating current work activities. \\nThe “earliest” scenario flexes all \\nparameters to the extremes of plausible \\nassumptions, resulting in faster \\nautomation development and adoption, \\nand the “latest” scenario flexes all \\nparameters in the opposite direction. \\nThe reality is likely to fall somewhere \\nbetween the two.\\n\\nOur analysis assesses the potential for technical automation \\nacross some 2,100 activities and 18 capabilities.\\n\\n~850 occupations\\n\\nExamples\\n\\n~2,100 activities assessed \\nacross all occupations\\n\\nCapability requirements\\n\\nExample: Retail activities\\n\\n• Answer questions about \\nproducts and services\\n\\n• Greet customers\\n• Clean and maintain work areas\\n• Demonstrate product features\\n• Process sales and transactions \\n\\nSensory\\n• Sensory perception\\n\\nCognitive \\n• Retrieving information \\n• Recognizing known \\n\\npatterns and categories \\n(supervised learning)\\n\\n• Generating novel patterns \\n\\nand categories \\n\\n• Logical reasoning and \\n\\nproblem solving \\n\\n• Optimizing and planning\\n• Creativity \\n• Articulating/display output\\n• Coordination with multiple \\n\\nagents\\n\\nPhysical \\n• Fine motor skills and \\n\\ndexterity\\n\\n• Gross motor skills\\n• Navigation \\n• Mobility\\n\\nNatural-language \\nprocessing\\n• Understanding natural \\n\\nlanguage\\n\\n• Generating natural language\\n\\nSocial \\n• Social and emotional \\n\\nsensing\\n\\n• Social and emotional \\n\\nreasoning\\n\\n• Social and emotional output\\n\\nRetail \\nsalespeople\\n\\nHealth \\npractitioners  \\n\\nFood and beverage \\nservice workers\\n\\nTeachers\\n\\nSource: McKinsey Global Institute analysis \\n\\nMcKinsey & Company\\n\\n34\\n\\nThe economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier\\n\\n \\n\\x0cAccelerating the technical potential to transform knowledge work\\n\\nBased on developments in generative AI, technology performance is now expected to \\nmatch median human performance and reach top quartile human performance earlier \\nthan previously estimated across a wide range of capabilities (Exhibit 6).

That in turn has sped up the pace at which automation may be deployed \\nand expanded the types of workers who will experience its impact. Like other technologies, \\nits ability to take on routine tasks and work can increase human productivity, which has grown \\nat a below-average rate for almost 20 years.18 It can also offset the impact of aging, which is \\nbeginning to put a dent in workforce growth for many of the world’s major economies. But to \\nachieve these benefits, a significant number of workers will need to substantially change the \\nwork they do, either in their existing occupations or in new ones. They will also need support in \\nmaking transitions to new activities.\\n\\n46\\n\\nThe economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier\\n\\n\\x0cThe economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier\\n\\n47\\n\\n\\x0c4\\n\\nConsiderations for \\nbusinesses and society\\n\\nHistory has shown that new technologies have the potential to reshape societies. Artificial \\nintelligence has already changed the way we live and work—for example, it can help our \\nphones (mostly) understand what we say, or draft emails. Mostly, however, AI has remained \\nbehind the scenes, optimizing business processes or making recommendations about the \\nnext product to buy. The rapid development of generative AI is likely to significantly augment \\nthe impact of AI overall, generating trillions of dollars of additional value each year and \\ntransforming the nature of work.\\n\\nBut the technology could also deliver new and significant challenges. Stakeholders must \\nact—and quickly, given the pace at which generative AI could be adopted—to prepare to \\naddress both the opportunities and the risks. Risks have already surfaced, including concerns \\nabout the content that generative AI systems produce: Will they infringe upon intellectual \\nproperty due to “plagiarism” in the training data used to create foundation models? Will the \\nanswers that LLMs produce when questioned be accurate, and can they be explained? Will \\nthe content generative AI creates be fair or biased in ways that users do not want by, say, \\nproducing content that reflects harmful stereotypes?\\n\\n48\\n\\nThe economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier\\n\\n\\x0cThere are economic challenges too: the scale and the scope of the workforce transitions \\ndescribed in this report are considerable. In the midpoint adoption scenario, about a quarter \\nto a third of work activities could change in the coming decade. The task before us is to \\nmanage the potential positives and negatives of the technology simultaneously (for more \\nabout the potential risks of generative AI, see Box 5). Here are some of the critical questions \\nwe will need to address while balancing our enthusiasm for the potential benefits of the \\ntechnology with the new challenges it can introduce. \\n\\nBox 5\\nUsing generative AI responsibly\\n\\nGenerative AI poses a variety of risks. \\nStakeholders will want to address these \\nrisks from the start. \\n\\nFairness: Models may generate \\nalgorithmic bias due to imperfect training \\ndata or decisions made by the engineers \\ndeveloping the models.\\n\\nIntellectual property (IP): Training \\ndata and model outputs can generate \\nsignificant IP risks, including infringing \\non copyrighted, trademarked, patented, \\nor otherwise legally protected materials. \\nEven when using a provider’s generative \\nAI tool, organizations will need to \\nunderstand what data went into training \\nand how it’s used in tool outputs.\\n\\nPrivacy: Privacy concerns could arise if \\nusers input information that later ends \\nup in model outputs in a form that makes \\n\\nindividuals identifiable. Generative \\nAI could also be used to create and \\ndisseminate malicious content such as \\ndisinformation, deepfakes, and hate \\nspeech.\\n\\nSecurity: Generative AI may be \\nused by bad actors to accelerate the \\nsophistication and speed of cyberattacks. \\nIt also can be manipulated to provide \\nmalicious outputs. For example, through a \\ntechnique called prompt injection, a third \\nparty gives a model new instructions that \\ntrick the model into delivering an output \\nunintended by the model producer and \\nend user.\\n\\nExplainability: Generative AI relies \\non neural networks with billions of \\nparameters, challenging our ability \\n\\nto explain how any given answer is \\nproduced.\\n\\nReliability: Models can produce different \\nanswers to the same prompts, impeding \\nthe user’s ability to assess the accuracy \\nand reliability of outputs.\\n\\nOrganizational impact: Generative AI \\nmay significantly affect the workforce, \\nand the impact on specific groups \\nand local communities could be \\ndisproportionately negative.\\n\\nSocial and environmental impact: The \\ndevelopment and training of foundation \\nmodels may lead to detrimental social and \\nenvironmental consequences, including \\nan increase in carbon emissions (for \\nexample, training one large language \\nmodel can emit about 315 tons of carbon \\ndioxide).1  \\n\\n1  Ananya Ganesh, Andrew McCallum, and Emma Strubell, “Energy and policy considerations for deep learning in NLP,” Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the \\n\\nAssociation for Computational Linguistics, June 5, 2019.\\n\\nCompanies and business leaders\\nHow can companies move quickly to capture the potential value at stake highlighted in this \\nreport, while managing the risks that generative AI presents?\\n\\nHow will the mix of occupations and skills needed across a company’s workforce be \\ntransformed by generative AI and other artificial intelligence over the coming years? How will \\na company enable these transitions in its hiring plans, retraining programs, and other aspects \\nof human resources?\\n\\nDo companies have a role to play in ensuring the technology is not deployed in “negative use \\ncases” that could harm society? \\n\\nHow can businesses transparently share their experiences with scaling the use of generative \\nAI within and across industries—and also with governments and society? \\n\\nThe economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier\\n\\n49\\n\\n\\x0cPolicy makers\\nWhat will the future of work look like at the level of an economy in terms of occupations and \\nskills?

Are there earn-while-you-learn programs such as apprenticeships that \\ncould enable people to retrain while continuing to support themselves and their families?\\n\\nWhat steps can policy makers take to prevent generative AI from being used in ways that \\nharm society or vulnerable populations? \\n\\nCan new policies be developed and existing policies amended to ensure human-centric AI \\ndevelopment and deployment that includes human oversight and diverse perspectives and \\naccounts for societal values? \\n\\nIndividuals as workers, consumers, and citizens\\nHow concerned should individuals be about the advent of generative AI? While companies \\ncan assess how the technology will affect their bottom lines, where can citizens turn for \\naccurate, unbiased information about how it will affect their lives and livelihoods? \\n\\nHow can individuals as workers and consumers balance the conveniences generative AI \\ndelivers with its impact in their workplaces? \\n\\nCan citizens have a voice in the decisions that will shape the deployment and integration of \\ngenerative AI into the fabric of their lives? \\n\\nTechnological innovation can inspire equal parts awe and concern. When that innovation \\nseems to materialize fully formed and becomes widespread seemingly overnight, both \\nresponses can be amplified. The arrival of generative AI in the fall of 2022 was the most \\nrecent example of this phenomenon, due to its unexpectedly rapid adoption as well as the \\nensuing scramble among companies and consumers to deploy, integrate, and play with it. \\n\\nAll of us are at the beginning of a journey to understand this technology’s power, reach, \\nand capabilities. If the past eight months are any guide, the next several years will take us \\non a roller-coaster ride featuring fast-paced innovation and technological breakthroughs \\nthat force us to recalibrate our understanding of AI’s impact on our work and our lives. It is \\nimportant to properly understand this phenomenon and anticipate its impact. Given the speed \\nof generative AI’s deployment so far, the need to accelerate digital transformation and reskill \\nlabor forces is great. \\n\\nThese tools have the potential to create enormous value for the global economy at a time \\nwhen it is pondering the huge costs of adapting and mitigating climate change. At the same \\ntime, they also have the potential to be more destabilizing than previous generations of \\nartificial intelligence. They are capable of that most human of abilities, language, which is a \\nfundamental requirement of most work activities linked to expertise and knowledge as well as \\na skill that can be used to hurt feelings, create misunderstandings, obscure truth, and incite \\nviolence and even wars. \\n\\nWe hope this research has contributed to a better understanding of generative AI’s capacity \\nto add value to company operations and fuel economic growth and prosperity as well as its \\npotential to dramatically transform how we work and our purpose in society. Companies, \\npolicy makers, consumers, and citizens can work together to ensure that generative AI \\ndelivers on its promise to create significant value while limiting its potential to upset lives and \\nlivelihoods.

How we sized the use case value potential \\n\\nOverall objective\\nThe objective was to estimate the potential economic impact of generative AI and foundation \\nmodels using a bottom-up assessment of the most relevant use cases across business \\nfunctions and industries. The resulting analysis approximates the potential value of generative \\nAI and foundation models in terms of productivity, or the equivalent amount by which the \\ntechnologies could reduce the global functional spending required to maintain current \\nrevenue levels. \\n\\nSummary of our approach\\nOur micro-to-macro use-case-based approach to estimating the potential impact of \\ngenerative AI included the following:\\n\\nHow we estimated the impact of generative AI across industries. We identified and cataloged \\ngenerative AI and foundation model use cases with input from experts from McKinsey’s \\nindustry and functional practices.

We collected expert inputs, the \\nresults of McKinsey internal experiments, and published research to estimate the potential \\nquantitative range of impact (in both cost savings and revenue uplift) and to gain qualitative \\nfindings from functions within individual use cases.2 Where generative AI and foundation \\nmodels are assumed to increase revenue, we recast the effect as an increase in productivity \\nthat would be the equivalent of the reduced level of spending required to maintain the same \\nlevel of output (thus enabling comparability with cost reductions).\\n\\nOur analysis of use cases only examines the direct impact of generative AI on productivity. \\nThey do not incorporate secondary benefits, such as the economic impact of hiring a more \\ncapable employee or hiring employees more rapidly.\\n\\nEstimate the impact across industries \\nTo estimate the impact of generative AI and foundation models across industries, we scaled \\nour analysis from a functional lens to an industry lens for each industry, assessing the weight \\nof functional costs. For instance, customer operations costs are higher in the telecom \\nindustry than in aerospace.\\n\\nFor each use case, the relevant costs were defined to account only for activities for which \\ngenerative AI or foundation models were likely to deliver productivity gains. For example, the \\ncost base against which we assessed productivity gains for the marketing function excludes \\nad buying costs because the use cases we assessed for generative AI in that function would \\nhave no productivity impact on the “ad buying” activity.\\n\\nA.  Global revenues for each industry in 2022 were sourced from IHS Markit and Oxford \\n\\nEconomics.\\n\\nB.  We estimated the functional cost for a function as a percentage of total revenue in an \\nindustry based on published data, industry experts, and McKinsey benchmarks. \\n\\n2  Generative AI at work, April 2023.\\n\\n54\\n\\nThe economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier\\n\\n\\x0cC.  For each function, we estimated the relevant costs (considering only underlying activities \\naffected by our use cases) as a portion of overall spending on a function, again informed \\nby published data, industry experts, and McKinsey benchmarks.\\n\\nD.  For each use case, we quantified the potential impact of generative AI and foundation \\nmodels based on the impact (either cost or revenue) as a function of the relevant \\naddressable spending. \\n\\nE.  We then calculated the impact by industry by aggregating the technology’s impact on use \\n\\ncases in an industry across functions. \\n\\nLimitations of our impact analysis\\nFor each use case, our analysis of the impact of generative AI and foundation models draws a \\nconservative base case and a more accelerated upside potential. The estimates are based on \\nexisting data and experiences, and these estimates could be updated over time. Additionally, \\nthe list of use cases is not exhaustive but is as comprehensive as possible, given our methods.\\n\\nThe estimates in this report should be treated as directional rather than precise, given the \\nnature of the technology and the wide range of uncertainty involved in the future development \\nof generative AI. We welcome challenges to our analysis as well as additional inputs that \\nwould refine and enhance it. \\n\\nComparison with the 2018 report Notes from the AI frontier: \\nApplications and value of deep learning\\nTo estimate the incremental impact that generative AI and foundation models could have \\nin comparison to the value of artificial intelligence overall, we updated our 2018 estimates \\nof the value that could be created through deployment of advanced analytics and previous \\ngenerations of artificial intelligence.3\\n\\nThis research incorporates 2022 updates to baseline financial variables such as industry \\nrevenues, enabling updates to the total potential economic impact of advanced analytics and \\nAI exclusive of generative AI and foundation models. \\n\\nIII.

Our analysis covers 47 countries \\nrepresenting more than 80 percent of the global economy. We used the US Bureau of Labor \\nStatistics O*Net data set that maps about 850 occupations to approximately 2,100 detailed \\nwork activities.\\n\\nEach detailed work activity was assessed against 18 capabilities that could potentially be \\nautomated based on the level of performance necessary to successfully perform that activity. \\nThese assessments were informed by academic research, McKinsey expertise, and industry \\nexperts. We defined four possible levels of requirement for each capability, ranging from \\nnot required to top-quartile human performance. Please refer to exhibits A1 to A4 of the \\ntechnical appendix in the January 2017 McKinsey Global Institute report, A future that works: \\nAutomation, employment, and productivity for more details on the capabilities and the four \\nrequirement levels.5\\n\\nAssigning the required level of capabilities to activities\\nWe used a machine learning algorithm to score the approximately 2,100 work activities \\nin relation to the 18 performance capabilities. To train the algorithm, we devised a list of \\nkeywords with input from experts. The algorithm scores each activity by matching keywords \\nfrom the capability to the activity title. These assessments were checked manually, and where \\nwe found anomalies, special requirements, or a need for nuance, we made adjustments—for \\nexample, in assessing the level of capabilities needed to navigate in extreme weather or \\non uneven surfaces and other unpredictable settings, or the different physical capabilities \\nrequired by a kindergarten teacher compared with a middle school teacher.\\n\\n1. Modeling of automation adoption timelines\\nOur adoption model assesses the automation development and adoption timeline at activity \\nlevel for more than 850 occupations across 19 sectors and 47 countries that represent more \\nthan 80 percent of the global economy. We divide the adoption process into four phases: \\ntechnical feasibility, solution development, economic feasibility, and end-user adoption.\\n\\nTechnical feasibility\\nFor a detailed work activity to be automated, technology must exist that performs at the \\nrequired level for each of the 18 capabilities. To update the progression scenarios for the \\nperformance capabilities over time, we surveyed experts in generative AI. We also conducted \\ninterviews with industry leaders and academic experts. Based on these assessments, we \\nupdated the expected time frames to reach each level of performance for each capability. In \\nour analysis and interaction with experts, we focused on the following capabilities that could \\nbe affected by generative AI:  \\n\\n — Natural-language understanding\\n\\n — Natural-language generation\\n\\n — Social and emotional reasoning\\n\\n — Emotional and social output\\n\\n — Social and emotional sensing\\n\\n — Coordination with multiple agents\\n\\n — Generating novel patterns or categories\\n\\n — Creativity\\n\\n5  Jobs lost, jobs gained: What the future of work will mean for jobs, skills, and wages, McKinsey Global Institute, November \\n\\n28, 2017.\\n\\n58\\n\\nThe economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier\\n\\n\\x0c — Logical reasoning and problem solving\\n\\n — Output articulation or display\\n\\n — Sensory perception\\n\\nSolution development\\nWe also updated our estimates for how long it would take to develop a solution that could \\nintegrate automation technologies once technical feasibility was established, based on \\na series of expert interviews. The original estimates were developed by examining the \\ndevelopment time and technical capabilities for more than 100 previously developed \\nautomation solutions, including hardware and software solutions. \\n\\nEconomic feasibility\\nOnce a solution is developed, we assume activities will start to be automated when the cost \\nof the solution falls below the level of wages paid to a human to do that activity. For this \\ncalculation, we accounted for the evolution of solution costs as well as the evolution of wages.\\n\\nSolution cost evolution\\nBased on the capability requirements, solutions are classified into two categories: hardware \\nand software. If a solution requires sensory perception, fine motor skills and dexterity, gross \\nmotor skills, or mobility, it is classified as a hardware solution. Otherwise, it is classified as \\na software solution. For a given solution, the initial cost is estimated as a percentage of the \\nhighest hourly wage for the corresponding activity across all the countries we modeled. \\nWe estimated the initial cost by examining several examples of solutions developed using \\ndifferent mixes of hardware and software. Based on our research, most software solutions \\nhave relatively low initial costs as a percentage of the human labor cost. Some solutions that \\nrequire a combination of both software and hardware components have a higher initial cost. \\nTo be conservative, we excluded certain solutions with advantages that could be derived only \\nfrom very specific scenarios or that include noneconomic benefits such as increased quality \\nand efficiency or decreased error rates. The range of initial solution costs we modeled is 20 \\nto 70 percent of the highest hourly wage for the corresponding activity for hardware, and 0 to \\n20 percent for software.\\n\\nIn our model, solution costs decrease as technology advances. Hardware solution costs \\ndecline by 16.0 percent per year, and software solution costs decline by 5.3 percent per year. \\nWe triangulate the consumer price index and supplier surveys to estimate the reduction in \\nhardware solution costs. For this, we use computer software and accessories indexes to \\nestimate software solution cost reduction. For consumer price inflation, we used consumer \\nprice index data for personal computers and peripheral equipment. For computer software \\nand accessories, we use data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. For software solution \\ncosts, we use a survey of prices from the International Federation of Robotics. Further work \\ncould be done to refine the estimation; however, given software’s low starting cost, annual \\nreductions have little impact on final automation results.\\n\\nWage evolution\\nWe model the wage evolution for each country in two stages. From 2023 to 2030, we apply \\ncountry-level growth estimates for all countries and convert them into 2010 constant US \\ndollars by dividing nominal GDP by the corresponding country-level price deflator (2010 \\nbase) and multiply the exchange rate to the dollar (2010 base). We then calculate a CAGR for \\neach country from 2022 to 2030. For 2030 onward, we grouped the 47 countries for which \\nwe have data into two cohorts using a cutoff country-level annual wage, based on the wage \\ndistribution from 2022 to 2030. Countries within the same cohort grow at the same rate. We \\nreclassify countries each year. As a country advances into the next cohort, the appropriate \\ngrowth rate is applied.\\n\\nThe economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier\\n\\n59\\n\\n\\x0cAdoption and deployment\\nAdoption can start once automation solutions are economically feasible, but several factors \\ncan hinder or enable the timing and the pace of adoption. Solutions requiring different \\ntechnologies have varying levels of ease of integration. It takes time to integrate capabilities \\ninto current technical platforms and combine them into an organic entity. Barriers also exist \\non the organization side. Human talent and organization structures might act as bottlenecks \\nto implementation. Policies and regulations could also slow down or accelerate technology \\ninnovation and adoption. Finally, depending on their preferences, consumers might have \\nvaried levels of acceptance for automated solutions that could affect the pace of adoption.\\n\\nTo incorporate all these factors, we used the mathematics of the Bass diffusion model, a well-\\nknown and widely used function in forecasting, especially for new product sales forecasting \\nand technology forecasting.\\n\\nF(t) is the installed base fraction (that is, adoption of given technology or product) and f(t) is \\nthe corresponding rate of change.\\n\\nThe function in our case also contains two key parameters: p parameter (the inherent \\ntendency of consumers to adopt new technology), and q parameter (the tendency of \\nconsumers to adopt based on peer adoption). Parameters are estimated through ordinary \\nleast square regression. In the absence of data, p and q parameter values from meta analyses \\ncan be used if a saturation value is known or can be guessed.\\n\\nWe then simulated two scenarios for historic technology adoption curves. The technologies \\nwe used are stents, airbags, laparoscopic surgery, MRI, smartphones, TVs, antilock braking \\nsystems, online air booking, cellphones, color TVs, SX/EW leaching, personal computers, \\nelectronic stability control, instrument landing systems, dishwashers, and pacemakers. The \\nfitted values of parameters p and q are consistent with other academic research. It takes \\nabout five years to reach 50 percent adoption in the earliest scenario and approximately 16 \\nyears in the latest scenario. \\n\\n2. Work hours that could be automated\\nThe impact of automation on work hours across different capability levels is estimated below \\nfor the technical automation potential and automation adoption:\\n\\nImpact by occupation by scenario: Number of FTEs X % automation estimate by scenario\\n\\nImpact by activity: Number of FTEs X time spent on activity per year6 X percent automation \\nestimate by scenario \\n\\nImpact by occupation group7 : Σoccupation (Number of FTEs X percent automation estimate by \\nscenario)\\n\\n3. Impact of automation on productivity\\nWe used GDP per FTE as the measure of productivity. We calculated automation output \\nunder different scenarios by multiplying the projected number of FTEs by the estimated \\nautomation adoption rate. To maintain consistency with other data sources, we made several \\nadditional assumptions. We considered only job activities that are available and well defined \\nas of the date of this report. Also, to be conservative, we assumed that automation has a labor \\n\\n6  FTEs whose job titles include these detailed work activities.\\n7  For occupations included within the occupation group.\\n\\n60\\n\\nThe economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier\\n\\n\\x0csubstitution effect but no other performance gains. Finally, we assumed that labor replaced \\nby automation will rejoin the workforce at the same level of productivity as today. We also \\nassumed that additional output from automation will not decrease, even if the total number of \\nFTEs declines as a result of demographic changes. \\n\\nUnder the assumptions outlined above, we calculated the GDP impact of automation adoption \\nby country as follows:\\n\\nAdditional GDP impact of automation = FTE impact of automation X productivity  \\n\\nThe additional GDP impact of automation is then added to 2022 GDP to estimate the \\nproductivity impact of automation.\\n\\nThe economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier\\n\\n61\\n\\n\\x0cAcknowledgments\\n\\nThe research underpinning this report was led by Michael Chui, an MGI partner in McKinsey’s \\nBay Area office; Eric Hazan, a senior partner in the Paris office; Roger Roberts, a partner in \\nthe Bay Area office; Alex Singla, a senior partner in the Chicago office; Kate Smaje and Alex \\nSukharevsky, senior partners in the London office; Lareina Yee, a senior partner in the Bay Area \\noffice; and Rodney Zemmel, a senior partner in the New York office. \\n\\nThe project team included Dmitry Gafarov, Shivani Gupta, Dan Hababou, Leila Harouchi, Sonja \\nLindberg, Kerin Lo, Alexandre Pons, Alok Singh, Gurneet Singh Dandona, and Wilbur Wang. \\n\\nThis research benefited immensely from the expertise and perspectives of many McKinsey \\ncolleagues.

More recently, COVID paved the way for a massive \\n\\ninterest  in  data  and  AI  domain,  stakeholders  are  now  fully \\n\\nembracing it, learning and sometimes succeeding on their way.\\n\\nIn 2022, we are celebrating the 5th edition of the AI for Health Summit. 5-years \\nis quite young, but old enough to see changes in this fast-evolving industry \\nthat is catching up at such a speedy pace.\\n\\nAfter the success of the two first editions, we come back this year even stronger \\nto  report  on  where  healthcare  organizations  stand  in  their  data  and  AI \\njourney. We have extended our scope and we now cover Pharmas, MedTechs, \\nTech  providers,  Startups,  Hospitals,  Research  labs,  Insurance,  Patients \\nand Regulators. \\n\\nAs part of the “AI for Health Global Conference”, held on November 16, 2022, \\nthis  report  gathers  a  large  panel  of  140+  respondents  into  an  online  survey, \\nalong  with  22  deep-dive  interviews  with  field  change  makers  that  bring \\ntheir  expertise  in  the  domain.  We  have  reached  some  statistical  significance \\nand international stature. We would like to thank our panel for their precious \\ninsights.\\n\\nSimilar to 2021, the ambition of this work is to help stakeholders get more \\nfamiliar with data AI strategic stakes and main applications, get a grasp of the \\nindustry’s  level  of  maturity,  while  providing  them  with  insights  on  the  main \\nroadblocks, ethical considerations, and operating choices they may face in \\ntheir journey to implement data and AI use cases. This year, we also provide an \\n“how to guide” to reach the next level of data and AI literacy depending on your \\nprofile.\\n\\nWe take away from this edition that healthcare stakeholders are mid-way in \\ntheir  data  and  AI  journey,  at  the  crossroads  of  their  ambition.  They  are \\ngetting their hands dirty with concrete use case delivery, sometimes meeting \\nsuccess and often facing challenges.\\n\\n4\\n\\nHealth & AI: Now and Next    2022 edition\\n\\n\\x0cWe  built  this  report  as  a  reference  but  also  as  a  mind  shaker  of  this  rich \\necosystem,  that  works  more  and  more  all  together  around  an  overarching \\ncommon  goal:  delivering  the  best  possible  care  to  individual  patients  in \\ntheir diversity and to society as a whole, at an affordable and sustainable cost. \\n\\nWe reiterate our ambition to have this report fully leveraged to ensure patients, \\npractitioners and authorities get the most out of the on-going revolution of \\ndata and AI in healthcare. More than ever, we are on a mission to democratize \\na  topic  that  every  player  can  have  a  role  in,  either  coming  from  a  business \\nbackground, a technical background or simply as a citizen.\\n\\nMake no mistake! The wind of change is now blowing everywhere across this \\nindustry.\\n\\nWe hope you will enjoy reading and using this report as much as we appreciated \\nworking on it. \\n\\nJoin us in shaping the future of AI for Health!\\n\\nDamien\\nGromier\\nFounder \\n& CEO  \\n\\nCharlotte\\nPierron Perlès\\nEVP Global Head of Insights\\nfor Intelligent Industry\\n\\nStéphanie\\nTrang\\nVice President  \\nEurope  \\n\\nBarnabé\\nLecouteux\\nSenior Director Insights for  \\nIntelligent Industry, Life Sciences\\n\\nAI for Health\\n\\nCapgemini Invent Global\\n\\nAI for Health \\n\\nCapgemini Invent France\\n\\nWe would like to give a special thanks to the partners of \\n\\n®\\n\\nHealth & AI: Now and Next    2022 edition\\n\\n5\\n\\n\\x0cTable \\nof contents\\n\\nExecutive summary \\n\\nP.8-10\\n\\nObjectives, methodology \\nand panel \\n\\nP.11-17\\n\\nStudy Objectives \\n\\nMethodology \\n\\nStudy Panel \\n\\nP.11-12\\n\\nP.13-15\\n\\nP.16-17\\n\\n6\\n\\nHealth & AI: Now and Next    2022 edition\\n\\n\\x0cKey Learnings \\n\\nP.18-75\\n\\nAI Strategy and Operating Model \\n\\nAI Maturity and Use cases \\n\\nTechnological choices \\n\\nEthics and privacy \\n\\nP.18-35\\n\\nP.36-57\\n\\nP.58-67\\n\\nP.68-75\\n\\nKey AI topics: a panorama \\n\\nP.76-97\\n\\nPatient centricity: getting there? \\n\\nNext healthcare system paradigm \\n\\nFuture of R&D \\n\\nNext generation engagement \\n\\nConnected Health \\n\\nData foundations \\n\\nAI/Data acculturation \\n\\nRegulator’s viewpoint \\n\\nP.79-80\\n\\nP.81-82\\n\\nP.83-85\\n\\nP.86-87\\n\\nP.88-89\\n\\nP.90-93\\n\\nP.94-95\\n\\nP.96-97\\n\\nContributors  \\nand acknowledgements \\n\\nP.98-103\\n\\nHealth & AI: Now and Next    2022 edition\\n\\n7\\n\\n\\x0cExecutive Summary\\n\\nFirst, we notice a continuity of the trends observed back in 2021.\\n\\nData and AI are still considered as key by organizations, although employee \\nacculturation is lagging behind. While dedicated units to address the matter \\nare  being  deployed,  they  are  still  too  far  away  from  decision  to  drive  the \\nnecessary  impact.  Offering  the  best  patient  care  in  terms  of  outcome  and \\njourney remains the top priority especially for Hospitals. Resource-wise, data \\nscientists  and  data  engineers  are  still  the  most  requested  profiles  on  the \\nmarketplace.\\n\\nOn maturity, the overall perception of the panel remains a feeling of a medium \\nmaturity  level.  Data  availability  -  data  not  always  complete  nor  made \\naccessible - and data quality - data not perceived reliable enough - still prevail \\nas the key barriers for use cases industrialization.\\n\\nOrganizations are still on their way towards more robust data foundations. \\nData  transformation  and  most  importantly  data  interoperability  (in  and \\nout) especially when working in ecosystem, show great room for improvement. \\nData visualization and machine / deep learning are still the most commonly \\nused processing techniques. Quantum technology, although booming in terms \\nof hype especially for drug discovery, is still in its infancy.\\n\\nWhen it comes to ethics and privacy, privacy can now be considered as an area \\nwhere stakeholders master the regulatory space and systematically address it.\\n\\nAt the same time, new trends are emerging this year.\\n\\nThe remit of data and AI organizations in healthcare clearly focuses on mastering \\nthe roadmap and more and more managing the collection, qualification and \\nprioritization of use cases. Ecosystem plays have always been game-changing \\nin the sector to create value, and they now accelerate with Startups and Hospitals \\nat the forefront. As maturity for data profiles’ need evolves, organizations know \\nhow to split core vs non core resources, that they would tend to externalize.\\n\\nIf maturity flattens, the commitment taken on industrialization for the years \\nto come show a great level of ambition. We can be confident in this ambition \\nmaterializing, since more and more use cases are on in the pipelines. As more \\nstakeholders  are  engaged  in  those  use  cases,  it  can  go  with  a  difficulty  to \\nengage the business.\\n\\n8\\n\\nHealth & AI: Now and Next    2022 edition\\n\\n\\x0cAs for technical arbitration, we observe a progressive move to cloud from players \\nbeyond Startups, for whom this shift has always been a no brainer. Hospitals \\nand Research organizations are clearly accelerating there while Pharmas and \\nMedTechs,  that  are  more  advanced,  pursue  their  journey.  We  introduced  this \\nyear the topic of sustainability in the discussion: although not considered central \\n(yet), the dimension is gaining importance in decision-making.\\n\\nAs  for  ethics  and  privacy,  the  panel  echoes  the  call  for  greater  model \\nexplainability  especially  for  Hospitals  and  Research  organizations.  Finally, \\ndata sovereignty stands out as a growing concern in choices, reinforced by \\nthe context of growing political instability.\\n\\nWe propose a maturity pattern in this year barometer, where we address the \\n“how  to  reach  the  next  stage”  question.  For  large  organizations,  improving \\nemployee acculturation and infusing innovation outside-in seem to be the \\nmost impactful levers. Also, moving from the medium state (“transitional”) to \\nthe most advanced one (“experienced”) would be easier for Startups than for \\nothers, which can be a great source of inspiration for large organizations.\\n\\nWhen taking the different panel stakeholders one by one, we notice that they \\nwill now very much concentrate on their core capabilities in their effort to \\ndevelop and scale data and AI use cases:\\n\\n  Pharmas/MedTechs  focus  their  efforts  on  big  data  drug  discovery  and \\non  cracking  the  code  of  efficient  developments  to  hit  the  market  faster, \\ncheaper and with more sucess;\\n\\n  Hospitals  &  clinics  are  still  very  much  into  improving  care  organizations \\ninside their walls and more and more into managing their transition to care \\nout of the hospital, especially for chronic disease management;\\n\\n  Research organizations become more and more open to their ecosystem \\nand are mixing fundamental and applied research, hence getting closer to \\nvalue for the end users;\\n\\n  Startups  would  address  big  Pharmas/MedTechs  and  Hospitals  as  their \\nmain clients with SaaS models. They tend to internalize the full data process \\nlifecycle, especially when it comes to cutting edge data science;\\n\\n  Insurance, also not statistically represented in this panel, favor marketing \\n\\n& sales and services for their clients.\\n\\nHealth & AI: Now and Next    2022 edition\\n\\n9\\n\\n\\x0cBeyond the buzzwords, we wanted to emphasize a couple of hot dimensions that \\nwe believe are central to how the AI for health ecosystem evolves:\\n\\n  Patient  centricity  is  a  concept  that  has  been  around  for  years.  Not  only  that \\nstakeholders now do have a better understanding of what patients - really - want \\nin their diversity, but they also feel better equipped to address their needs;\\n\\n  Care  systems  are  being  impacted  by  data  and  AI,  and  hence  progressively \\nintroducing shifts. Use cases are growing in Hospitals around care delivery and \\ncare  efficiency  improvements,  and  outside  of  Hospitals  with  care  coordination. \\nThe focus is on techniques that are the most mature (data visualization, Machine \\nLearning);\\n\\n  Startups, Big Pharmas and Research organizations are reshaping the panorama \\nof R&D. While in Research, we see more and more in silico approach to down-\\nselect the most promising drug candidates, sometimes leveraging Quantum, the \\nrace for a more efficient Drug development generates excitement around revisited \\nprocesses, new data sources and value adding use cases addressing patient and \\npractitioners pain points;\\n\\n  After COVID, there will be no going back to the old model of regular visit to the \\npractitioners with limited differentiation. Content, channel, timing and frequency \\nshould fit into the doctor’s agenda, leveraging techniques that are used in more \\nmature industries to shape the next generation engagement model;\\n\\n  Connected health, defined as the way to harness the power of new technology \\nto improve patient engagement and health outcomes is a play where Pharmas, \\nMedTechs and Startups have heavily invested over the years and still have a way \\nto go before getting value in return;\\n\\n  Building  a  solid  data  foundation,  no  matter  the  origin  and  type  of  data,  is \\na  necessary  condition  to  unleash  the  power  of  healthcare  data.  If  all  players \\nrecognize  that  the  matter  is  key,  they  also  acknowledge  that  they  are  mid-way, \\nwith most of them already having a tech platform, that now needs to be fed with \\nquality data serviced as-a-product, at the intersection of data, IT and business;\\n\\n  With data and AI entering in healthcare, we are dealing with an in-depth cultural \\nchange, that will not happen overnight. Many organizations are developing their \\nown acculturation initiatives to develop the data and AI literacy of their resources \\nin formats that are appealing. AI goes far beyond technical considerations;\\n\\n  All  of  the  above  cannot  fully  materialize  without  the  full  support  of  the \\nauthorities  that  regulate  products  (e.g:  drugs,  devices),  services  (e.g:  software, \\ncare intervention) and process (e.g: consent management, algorithm re-training) \\ndelivery and pricing. There is an overall call for simplification and co-construction \\nso that regulation can be more supportive of the innovation effort of the whole \\nindustry.\\n\\n10 Health & AI: Now and Next    2022 edition\\n\\n\\x0cStudy\\nObjectives\\n\\nSCOPE AND INTENT OF THE 2022 EDITION «HEALTH & AI: NOW AND NEXT»\\n\\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) is defined as the attempt to replicate \\nhuman  cognitive  capabilities  through  advanced  technology, \\nand  to  reach  goals  in  an  autonomous  way  by  considering  the \\nconstraints and obstacles of the environment.\\n\\nHealthcare  is  defined  as  the  improvement  of  health  via \\nprevention,  diagnosis,  treatment,  amelioration  or  cure  of  disease, \\nillness, injury, and other physical and mental impairments in people.\\n\\nHealth & AI: Now and Next    2022 edition\\n\\n11\\n\\n\\x0cAI for Health refers here to data and AI issues aiming to transform the \\nhealthcare sector through the development and the deployment of use \\ncases.

In this section, we will \\n\\nsee how players are reinventing their business models to better \\naddress their users’ needs.\\n\\n\\x0c\\x0cAI STRATEGY\\n& OPERATING MODEL\\n\\nKEY TAKE-AWAYS\\n\\n1\\n\\nLevel of executive engagement\\n& acculturation\\n\\nIn  continuity  with  2021  and  reinforced  by  COVID  19,  AI  is  still \\nconsidered a key top topic by organizations (3.1/4). However, the \\nlevel  of  acculturation  of  C-level  executives  is  lagging,  especially \\nfor  organizations  that  would  need  it  the  most,  i.e.,  Pharmas/\\nMedTechs and Hospital.\\n\\n2\\n\\nAI leadership\\n\\nIn this dimension, we do not see major progress from 2021. Two \\nthirds of players have put a Data and AI organization in place, one \\npositioned at C-level but still away from Exco. Those departments, \\nwhen existing, will oversee the data and AI roadmap.They are also  \\nincreasingly  responsible  for  demand  management  process,  i.e., \\nthe process of collecting, qualifying, and prioritizing the use cases.\\n\\n3\\n\\nBusiness priorities\\n\\nEnhancing the Patient Care pathway and improving Care delivery \\nremain on the top of the organizations’ agenda. In particular, this \\nis  a  priority  for  Hospitals  and  Research  organizations.  Despite \\npatients  becoming  more  mature  on  their  access  to  qualitative \\nmedical information, patient information has a priority by only \\none third of the panel. \\n\\n20 AI STRATEGY AND OPERATING MODEL     Health & AI: Now and Next\\n\\n\\x0c4\\n\\nPartnerships and open innovation \\n\\nCollaboration  between  actors  is  very  frequent.  Two-third  of  the \\npanel  say they rely at least sometimes on partnerships to deliver \\nData  and  AI  use  cases.  Collaborations  are  split  between  business \\n(Academics  going  slightly  down,  Startups  going  up)  and  technical \\ncollaboration (Technology, IT & less frequently data). When adopting \\nopen innovation frameworks, Startups and Hospitals are the ones \\nthat contribute the most to the construction of the ecosystem.\\n\\n5\\n\\nFocus on Startups\\n\\nAs the main clients, big private companies (Pharmas/MedTechs) and \\nHospitals  come  first.  The  subscription  business  model  represents \\nhalf of the panel, Pay-as-you go comes second and freemium went up \\nby a factor of five from 2021. When selling digital products, Software \\nas a Service (SaaS) is still the main mode,  but  PaaS  (Platform  as  a \\nService) is catching up.\\n\\n6\\n\\nData profiles\\n\\nIn  line  with  2020  and  2021,  data  scientists  and  data  engineers \\nare  still  positioned  as  the  two  must-have  profiles  across  all \\norganizations. We see a shift in large organizations’ externalization \\nof more commoditized and non-core data profiles. As for Startups, \\nthey tend to integrate the full data management process in-house \\nas  their  core  differentiator.  In  particular,  they  need  high  profile-\\ndata scientists that are knowledgeable in both the domain (biology, \\npatient journey management, et cetera) and the techniques (Machine \\nLearning, NLP, quantum, and so on).\\n\\nHealth & AI: Now and Next     AI STRATEGY AND OPERATING MODEL\\n\\n21\\n\\n\\x0cLevel of Executive engagement \\nand Acculturation\\nReinforced by the COVID-19 crisis, AI is still recognized as a \\nstrategic priority by executives. However, the level of acculturation \\nof C-level executives is lagging behind, especially for organization \\nthat would need it the most.\\n\\nHow important is AI to your organization’s strategy?\\n\\nNot\\nimportant\\n\\nAverage\\n\\n3.1/4\\n\\nVery \\nimportant\\n\\n3.0\\n\\n3.1\\n\\n3.3\\n\\n2.7\\n\\n3.1\\n\\nResearch \\nLab\\n\\nPharma \\nMedTech\\n\\nHospital\\n\\nInsurance\\n\\nHow would you evaluate the current Data and AI acculturation of \\n\\nyour C-level executives?\\n\\nLow \\nacculturation\\n\\nAverage\\n\\n2.6/4\\n\\nHigh \\nacculturation\\n\\n2.8\\n\\n2.5\\n\\n2.4\\n\\n3.5\\n\\n2.6\\n\\nResearch \\nLab\\n\\nPharma \\nMedTech\\n\\nHospital\\n\\nInsurance\\n\\n22 AI STRATEGY AND OPERATING MODEL     Health & AI: Now and Next\\n\\n\\x0c42%\\nNO\\n\\n58%\\n\\nYES\\n\\nAre there any initiatives \\n\\nlaunched or ongoing to secure \\n\\nmanagement acculturation \\n\\non Data and AI topics? \\n\\n(Training program, Learning \\n\\nexpeditions, challenges...)\\n\\nBased on a set of 55 respondents (incl. 26 Pharmas/MedTechs, 12 Hospitals,  \\n14 Research Labs and 3 insurances). \\n\\nWith no surprise, AI remains a strategic priority\\n\\nAmong organizations, AI is still considered as a strategic priority with \\n\\nan average of three quarters considering it as an important topic. Hos-\\n\\npitals  seem  to  be  the  most  engaged  (3.3/4),  but  they  are  also  facing \\n\\ndifficulties in acculturating their staff at the same time.\\n\\nExecutives level of acculturation is intermediate\\n\\nThe level of acculturation of 2.6/4 can be considered intermediate, si-\\n\\nmilar to last year, which implies that the needle has not changed that \\n\\nmuch.  It  is  noteworthy  that  Hospitals  lag  behind  the  cohort  (2.4/4), \\n\\nwhile Research labs have accelerated their acculturation (2.8/4 vs 2.0/4 \\n\\nin 2021). On a positive note, we also notice a far higher engagement \\n\\nlevel in companies of more than 500 employees.\\n\\nEfforts are maintained to secure this acculturation\\n\\nDespite an intermediate level of AI acculturation, the initiatives deployed \\n\\nto  secure  knowledges  have  not  grown  (58%  in  2022  versus  57%  in \\n\\n2021), except for Research Labs (from 50% to 79%).\\n\\nHealth & AI: Now and Next     AI STRATEGY AND OPERATING MODEL\\n\\n23\\n\\n\\x0cAI leadership\\n\\nOn AI leadership, we do not see major progress vs 2021. Around \\ntwo thirds of players have put a Data and AI organization in place, \\none that still remains away from the Exco.

It is a notion that patients themselves \\nhave created, as they want to have the industry refocused on their needs, \\ndrivers and behavior. Although the concept has been democratized in recent \\nyears and can sometimes be challenged, a lot remains to be done.\\n\\nPatient expectations\\nThese days, patients expect much more than medical \\nsupport  from  health  care  professionals.  They  expect \\nthem  to  be  considerate,  empathetic  and  really  care \\nfor  them  and  their  daily  life.  These  concerns  go  way \\nbeyond  their  disease  and  extend  to  their  personal \\nand  professional  lives.  They  would  like  to  be  mentally \\nsupported  in  what  they  are  going  through.  In  this \\nrespect, more than just information, patients ask for an \\nunderstanding of their personal situation, whether it \\nis the design of a clinical trial or the management of a \\nchronic disease.\\n\\nPatients  also  expect  their  care  pathway  to  be  less \\nfragmented.  They  want  to  be  able  to  access  the \\nright  care  service  when  they  need  it  the  most,  and \\nto  do  so  seamlessly.  Of  course,  patients  want  to  be \\nbetter  taken  care  of,  i.e.  to  have  access  to  the  best \\npossible  diagnostics,  treatments  and  services  on  the \\nmarket.  Finally,  care  affordability  is  also  a  key  issue, \\nparticularly for the most advanced diagnostic methods \\nor  treatments,  which  are  sometimes  not  fully  covered \\nby insurance policies.\\n\\nVirgine Rio\\nPresident\\n\\nBamp is the French \\nAssociation for medically \\nassisted reproduction. \\nWe provide  testimony, \\nreassurance and action! \\nIn that very personal \\nfield, patients are \\nlooking for quality \\ninformation, support in \\ntheir own journey, and \\ntransparency about \\nthe outcome.\\n\\nAdel Mebarki\\nCEO\\n\\nMain barriers & challenges\\nBeing patient centric is not an easy task. The first barrier \\nis having access to a representative panel of patients \\nto collect their feedback. This entails a profound change \\nin  the  way  organizations  and  the  system  operate, \\nmoving  from  a  doctor-centered  system  to  a  patient-\\ncentered paradigm.\\n\\nFrom our experience, the \\nfirst issue that comes up \\nfrom patients is a request \\nfor information. And 80% of \\npatient questions remain \\nunanswered to date!\\n\\nHealth & AI: Now and Next     KEY AI TOPICS: a panorama\\n\\n79\\n\\n\\x0cThat  being  said,  finding  the  right  balance  between  the \\nflexibility given to the patients in their care pathway and the \\nnecessary rigor required by protocols and prescriptions is a \\ncomplex topic.\\n\\nInitiatives to become more patient-centric\\nOrganizations are creating departments specifically dedicated \\nto patient centricity. Such departments would represent the \\nvoice of the patient, for instance when it comes to designing \\nclinical  trials.  Partnering  with  Patient  associations  is  also \\na  common  solution.  Some  advanced  organizations  would \\nincorporate patients or volunteers in the research process or \\nduring the (re)design of treatment protocols.\\n\\nHelping  patients  can  also  be  done  by  assisting  health  care \\nstaff  to  refocus  on  the  patient.  It  can  be  done  by  granting \\nsome  trainings,  providing  them  tools  to  ease  their  daily \\npractice or means to better communicate with patients. \\n\\nTrends for the coming years\\nParticipatory medicine is seen as a strong underlying trend \\nfor the years to come. Patients will become more and more \\nactive – and demanding - in their treatment.\\n\\nPatient data will be collected through different channels that \\nwill  encompass  multiple  aspects  of  the  patient’s  life  going \\nbeyond treatment endpoints (i.e. diet, physical activity, sleep, \\netc.),  serving  the  purpose  of  a  better  predictability  at  the \\npatient level. This data collection can be done via “non invasive” \\ndevices to secure a continuum of follow-ups, particularly for \\nfrail, elderly, or isolated patients. Thus, patients will be more \\naware of their health status and reach out to their healthcare \\nprofessionals outside of their medical visits. Patients will also \\nbe the owner of their health data and will decide with whom \\nand for what purpose they share it (or not). Blockchain could \\nalso  ensure  data  integrity  and  trackability  for  patients  and \\nhealthcare practitioners.\\n\\n80 KEY AI TOPICS: a panorama     Health & AI: Now and Next\\n\\n\\x0c\\u20092\\n\\nNEXT HEALTHCARE SYSTEM PARADIGM\\n\\nData and AI have the ability to deeply change the way care is delivered \\nto patients. It covers improving the quality of diagnosis, intervention \\nand treatments, improving care efficiency and smoothening complex \\npatient journeys inside and outside hospitals.\\n\\nA step-by-step adoption journey\\nThe  adoption  of  AI  within  Hospitals  is  taking  longer \\nthan anticipated. Players will start with data structuring \\nand retrieval first, before going into AI. In AI, the latest \\nprogress  is  concentrated  around  the  optimization \\nof  resources  (human,  financial,  equipment),  patient \\ninteractions,  and  screening  of  chronic  diseases  (e.g., \\nscreening for diabetic retinopathy). Although solutions \\nare coming, the value of AI remains to be demonstrated \\nat  scale  in  other  areas  such  as  prevention,  diagnosis, \\nand treatment.\\n\\nIn  addition  to  improving  patient  management  in  the \\nhospital,  AI  has  the  potential  to  greatly  improve  the \\npatient  journey  on  complex  care  pathways  involving \\nhospital,  general  practitioners,  lab  tests,  et  cetera. \\nDigital  tools  can  provide  continuity  of  care  outside  of \\nthe  hospitals’  walls.  We  talk  about  “phygital”  care.  The \\nbasis  remains  care  delivered  at  hospital,  but  with  the \\naddition  of  digital  solutions  to  an  eye  on  the  patients \\nand  detect  early  signs  of  a  condition  getting  worse. \\nIn  order  to  be  really  patient-centric,  the  system  also \\nneeds  to  be  caregiver-centric.  To  be  adopted,  digital \\ntools  need  to  propose  use  cases  that  provide  actual \\nbenefits to healthcare professionals as well.\\n\\nin \\n\\ninnovation \\n\\nFinally,  we  can  notice  some \\nthe \\nsustainability  space.  As  an  example,  a  tool  developed \\nby  the  CHUM  (Centre  Hospitalier  de  l’Université  de \\nMontréal)  calculates  the  costs  and  carbon  footprint  of \\nan operating room to make surgeons and their clinicians \\naware of the waste related to interventions. Costs saved \\nare then put back into the department for other missions \\nof the CHUM (e.g.: research, education, innovation).\\n\\nKathy Malas\\nDirector for \\nInnovation & AI\\n\\nMore than culture, we \\nneed funding, specialized \\nprofiles and a dedicated \\nteam to anchor data and \\nAI to the hospital.\\n\\nDorothée Moisy\\nInnovation \\nDirector\\n\\nTo generalize data and \\nIA, the innovations \\nshould be at the service \\nof the healthcare \\nprofessionals and  \\nsupport them on their \\ndaily practice.\\n\\nHealth & AI: Now and Next     KEY AI TOPICS: a panorama\\n\\n81\\n\\n\\x0cÁngel \\nAlberich-Bayarri \\nCEO\\n\\nThe biggest change \\nin the coming years \\nin AI for imaging is \\nto go from diagnosis \\nto prediction. To \\ndeliver that promise, \\nnew algorithms \\nshould be built and \\ndeployed around \\nclinical outcomes (e.g.: \\nsurvival, relapse, etc.).\\n\\nBut barriers to adoption remain\\nIn order to integrate data and AI within the Hospitals, it \\nis still difficult to bring all stakeholders around the table, \\nin  particular  doctors  and  nurses  due  to  the  little  time \\nthey can dedicate. A majority still lack prior knowledge \\non  the  fundamentals  of  data  and  AI  together  with  no \\nclear conviction on what it could benefit to their daily \\npractice.

Connected  health  –  which  sits \\nat the intersection of digital and traditional care – is regularly discussed \\nas  a  way  to  harness  the  power  of  new  technology  to  improve \\npatient  engagement  and  health  outcomes.  Numerous  companies \\nhave taken up the topic, mostly major Pharmas, MedTechs and Startups. \\nConnected health is still in its infancy though, especially when it comes to \\ndemonstrating value.\\n\\nJeanne Kehren\\nSVP Digital & Commercial \\nInnovation & CIO\\n\\nDuring summer 2022, \\nBayer launched Calantic™, \\na digital solution to \\noptimize the workflow \\nexecution for the Imaging \\nHealth Care Professional \\nand help address radiology \\nindustry challenges.

But  both  approaches \\nimproving  the \\nserve  the  same  purpose: \\npatient  experience  and  care.  For  the  care \\nteams,  the  objective  is  to  support  them  in \\ntheir core mission: bringing the best possible \\ncare  to  their  patients.  This  may  involve \\nteleconsultation,  tools  that  allow  remote \\nmonitoring of patients suffering from chronic \\ndiseases or after surgery. There are also tools \\nwhose  objective  is  to  increase  productivity, \\ne.g.:  enhancing  the  throughout  in  radiology. \\nDown the line, the objective is to save precious \\ntime  for  practitioners.    As  for  the  patients, \\nconnected  health  spans  from  beyond  the \\npill  services  to  a  treatment  in  itself  (“digital \\ntherapeutics”).    Beyond  the  pill,  services  can \\nbe  education,  medical \\ninformation,  self-\\ntracking, and financial support.\\n\\nShort-term,  value-adding  solutions  are  more \\nfocused on treatment/monitoring. Medium to \\nlong term, use cases will more likely be focused \\non awareness/prevention and diagnosis.\\n\\n88 KEY AI TOPICS: a panorama     Health & AI: Now and Next\\n\\n\\x0cConnected health growth \\nstill has a long way to go before \\nreaching scale\\nIn  most  cases,  connected  health  does  not \\nreplace  the  expertise  in  diagnosis  and  follow-\\nup  of  a  doctor  or  the  intake  of  drugs  by \\npatients  that  have  already  proven  its  efficacy \\nand  safety.  It  comes  more  as  a  “companion” \\nsupporting  doctors  and  patients  along  the \\nway.    Value  created  would  in  many  cases  be \\nindirect.  Hence,  finding  connected  health \\nbusiness models is instrumental. Value drivers \\nhave therefore to be thought through from the \\nideation  phase  to  avoid  surprises  in  delivery. \\nAnother reason for the very gradual expansion \\nof  connected  health  solutions  is  the  difficulty \\nfor organizations to create an environment of \\ntrust around data collection. Connected health \\ncertainly  needs  data,  data  that  patients  can \\nbe  reluctant  to  give  from  a  privacy  protection \\nstandpoint  or  because  it  could  become  too \\ninvasive  in  their  daily  lives.  Finally,  we  can \\nmention  the  topic  of  reimbursement.

With no exception, all players on the panel recognize that data \\nfoundation is a key component in their future development but acknowledge that \\nthey have a long way to go.\\n\\nHow is data leveraged in \\nhealthcare?\\nWhen  designing  data  foundations,  it  is  important \\nto  consider  from  the  start  the  nature  of  data \\n(sensitive-/-non-sensitive,  complex-/-simple,  etc.). \\nThe players insist on the fact that data foundations \\nmust be built in parallel of their use cases to have \\nan  architecture  that  corresponds  to  the  needs  of \\nthe business at a given point in time. \\n\\nData used by healthcare organizations can be very \\ndiverse.  Indeed,  data  has  different  structures: \\nsome  data  is  structured  (e.g.,  IoT,  efficacy  and \\nsafety  date),  and  others  would  be  unstructured \\n(e.g.,  imaging,  voice,  social  network  data).  Data \\ncomes  from  different  sources  (clinical  trials, \\nmedical  records,  biological  data,  and  omics,  ...). \\nData  also  has  different  application  domains \\n(e.g.,  epidemiology,  clinical  trials,  marketing,  and \\nreimbursement).  Finally,  data  have  a  temporal \\ncharacter  and  must \\ntherefore  be  updated \\nfrequently. From there, we can easily understand \\nthe complexity of building and maintaining a solid \\ndata  foundation.  Without  a  proper  foundation, \\nthere is no possibility to scale use cases up.\\n\\nRomain Bey\\nHead of Data \\nScience Department\\n\\nThe data warehouse of \\nAPHP was first approved \\nin France, in 2017. From a \\nstrong backbone of patient \\nmedical records, we \\nhave built a marketplace \\nthat fed 200 projects \\napproved by our scientific \\ncommittee. The initiative \\neven has some impact on \\nday-to-day practice, for \\ninstance in data inputs or \\nadditional labeling that we \\ncan request.\\n\\n90 KEY AI TOPICS: a panorama     Health & AI: Now and Next\\n\\n\\x0cOrganizations are halfway through their journey\\nWe can consider data foundations as a 5-step cycle. The first step corresponds \\nto  the  implementation  of  processes  to  ensure  basics.  Organizations  that \\nexploit  data  have  all  built  such  processes.  The  second  step  of  the  cycle \\ncorresponds to data accessibility. It is about giving access to the right data \\nto the right actors through a convenient searchable experience. This can be \\ndone  by  creating  data  catalogs,  setting  up  data  compliance  and  ensuring \\ngood  data  security,  especially  for  personal  health  data.  Here  again,  the \\nplayers have generally put these procedures in place. The third step of the \\ncycle corresponds to the creation of a data platform (generally on the cloud, \\neven  though  some  players  would  still  prefer  it  to  stay  on-site)  that  allows \\nserviceable  data  usage  along  the  cycle  (ingestion,  storage,  transformation, \\nusage).  Most  small  and  medium-sized  companies  are  at  this  stage.  The \\nfourth step of the journey corresponds to the use of data « as a service »,  \\nnotably  through  data  products.  Only  the  most  advanced  companies,  such \\nas big Pharmas, are at this stage and are starting to create value from data, \\noften for internal use. Lastly, the fifth step corresponds to the use of data \\nto create value for third parties. Very few structures would be there.

It can take the form of certified programs, that \\nwould be recognized by the market.\\n\\nFrom a format perspective, we see more and more hybrid models (a combination \\nof face-to-face and remote) and split of content in small capsules that are easy to \\nconsume “on-the-go” on different devices (computers, tablets and smartphones).\\n\\n94 KEY AI TOPICS: a panorama     Health & AI: Now and Next\\n\\n\\x0cSome acculturation initiatives we came across\\n\\nThe  launch  of  the  School  of  AI \\nin  Health  in  2018,  supports  the \\ncommunity  in  developing  AI  in  a \\nresponsible and ethical manner.\\n\\n3,000 students, \\n30,000 \\nlearners through conferences, \\n\\n75 organizations\\n\\nwww.eiaschum.ca/en\\n\\nDevelopment of training \\n\\ncourses for clinicians \\n\\n(including training related to \\n\\ntools) and training addressed \\n\\nto actors from technical \\n\\nfields to understand \\n\\nHospitals and biology \\n\\nchallenges.\\n\\nStructuration of an ad hoc \\n\\nLaunch of a data science academy \\n\\ncommittee (DPO, legal advisor, \\n\\nto acculturate executives in 2021.\\n\\nresearchers,…) and set-up of \\n\\nassociated governance.\\n\\n5,000 executives acculturated  \\nto date.\\n\\nIntrapreneurship program allowing employees to propose \\nprojects and be selected for the most important digital \\nhackathon in Europe (Hackathon Health Camp).\\n\\nwww.hackinghealth.camp/\\n\\nHealth & AI: Now and Next     KEY AI TOPICS: a panorama\\n\\n95\\n\\n\\x0c8\\n\\nTHE REGULATOR’S VIEWPOINT\\n\\nDepending  on  the  services  and/or  products  they  develop,  organizations  must \\ncomply  with  various  regulations  at  regional  (e.g.,  EU  and  US),  national  and \\nsometimes sub-national levels. This regulation landscape would vary over time. \\nPrivacy (regulated by GDPR in the EU) is a top consideration, given the sensitivity \\nof healthcare data. We also see new areas of regulation popping up like AI and \\nsustainability.\\n\\nA complex regulatory framework…\\nFor most of the past decade, concerns about digital have focused on the potential \\nabuse and misuse of data. Those concerns led Regulators to create measures in \\nthe United States and European Union guaranteeing the user to have some level of \\ncontrol over their personal data (GDPR and Privacy Act). In addition to this privacy \\nconcern,  organizations  also  must  comply  with  regulations  regarding  products, \\nservices, and processes at every step of their value chain. Those regulations can \\nbe  national,  European  or  international.  This  makes  their  implementation  even \\nmore complex.\\n\\n… with AI now being reviewed\\nWhile the benefits of AI in healthcare is not to be proven, patients still need protection \\nfrom defective diagnoses, unacceptable use of personal data, and the elimination \\nof  bias  that  could  be  built-in  unintentionally  within  healthcare  algorithms.  As  an \\nanswer  to  this,  the  legal  framework  is  entering  a  new  phase.  As  organizations \\nincreasingly  embed  AI  in  their  products,  services,  and  processes,  and  decision-\\nmaking Regulators’ attention is shifting to how data is used by the AI application.\\n\\nEU  has  drafted  the  EU  AI  Act,  first  of  a  kind \\nfor  a  major  regulator.  The  project  assigns \\napplications  of  AI  to  three  risk  categories: \\napplications  and  systems  that  create  an \\nunacceptable  risk,  high-risk  applications  and \\nfinally  applications  not  explicitly  banned \\nor  listed  as  high-risk  that  are  largely  left \\nunregulated.  Healthcare \\nthe \\ncategory  of  high-risk  applications,  with  a  fear \\nfrom  the  industry  that  the  regulation  could \\npile-up compared to others.\\n\\nfalls  under \\n\\n96 KEY AI TOPICS: a panorama     Health & AI: Now and Next\\n\\n\\x0cA call for support and \\nco-construction\\nThis  legislative  acceleration  leads  to  a  need  for \\nclarification:  which  regulation  to  comply  with, \\nunder  which  timeline?  Due  to  the  co-existence  of \\nseveral  regulations,  organizations  need  resources \\nand  guidance  to  support  them  in  reaching  legal \\ncompliance.  That  is  particularly  true  in  the  field  of \\nmedical  devices,  and  even  more  for  software  as \\nmedical devices. In most cases also, Regulators would \\nset  high  objectives  without  defining  methodologies \\nto  get  there.  Organizations  are  looking  for  a  “how-\\nto-guide” to get there.

We have extended our scope and we now cover Pharmas, MedTechs, \\nTech providers, Startups, Hospitals, Research labs, Insurance, Patients  \\nand Regulators. \\nAs part of the “AI for Health Global Conference”, held on November 16, 2022, \\nthis report gathers a large panel of 140+ respondents into an online survey, \\nalong with 22 deep-dive interviews with field change makers that bring \\ntheir expertise in the domain. We have reached some statistical significance \\nand international stature. We would like to thank our panel for their precious \\ninsights.\\nSimilar to 2021, the ambition of this work is to help stakeholders get more  \\nfamiliar with data AI strategic stakes and main applications, get a grasp of the \\nindustry’s level of maturity, while providing them with insights on the main \\nroadblocks, ethical considerations, and operating choices they may face in \\ntheir journey to implement data and AI use cases. This year, we also provide an \\n“how to guide” to reach the next level of data and AI literacy depending on your \\nprofile.\\nWe take away from this edition that healthcare stakeholders are mid-way in \\ntheir data and AI journey, at the crossroads of their ambition. They are \\ngetting their hands dirty with concrete use case delivery, sometimes meeting \\nsuccess and often facing challenges.Since 2016, tech leaders are developing their collaborations with \\nhealthcare institutions: Google launched 12 projects, Microsoft 7 \\nand Amazon 5. More recently, COVID paved the way for a massive \\ninterest in data and AI domain, stakeholders are now fully \\nembracing it, learning and sometimes succeeding on their way.'"

From finance to clinical \\noperations, to manufacturing and supply, AI-powered tools are \\nhelping us make data-driven decisions easier and faster.\\n\\nWeaving AI across Sanofi\\n\\nWe adopted AI at scale with the release of Plai, \\nan app that aggregates and showcases data \\nfrom across the business in reactive, real-time \\ndashboards. Plai provides timely insights and \\npersonalized “what if” scenarios to support \\nthousands of decision makers with the data \\nthey need.\\n\\nWe further ramped up our innovation with \\nthe launch of OneAI, a machine learning and \\nAI platform purpose-built for Sanofi. With one \\nunified platform, the connected applications \\nwill improve themselves and continuously learn \\nfrom each other.\\n\\nFor our R&D teams, AI means tasks are now \\ncompleted in a fraction of the time.

Today, this process \\nis fully digital and takes just two minutes \\ninstead of 15 days.\\n\\nAI is also central to our work on vaccines. For \\nan mRNA vaccine to reach its designated cells \\nand produce disease-fighting proteins, it must \\nbe carried by a stable drug delivery system via a \\nspecial particle. We have a large library of special \\nparticles in our labs, and in 2022, we used AI to \\ncreate two digital models to predict the strongest \\nselection of particles, saving countless hours \\nexploring what does and doesn’t work.\\n\\nOur digital tools don’t just speed up our R&D— \\nthey also help us get treatments to patients more \\neffectively.

In 2022, we launched \\nfive global Employee Resource Groups (ERGs): \\nGender+, Generations+, Pride+, Ability+, and \\nCulture and Origins+. These voluntary, employee- \\nled groups share knowledge and resources on focus \\nareas, from gender or cultural equity, to mental \\nwellbeing. Each group is sponsored by a member \\nof our Executive Committee who acts as an ally \\nfor these communities at senior leadership level.\\n\\nAllyship helps us drive change. It means speaking \\nup for under-represented communities and taking \\naction to help achieve equity and inclusion. Our \\nERGs co-created an allyship guide to help people \\ndo just that, while broadening their understanding \\nof these communities and the discrimination \\nthey may face.\\n\\nLife that works \\n\\n2022 was a big year for improving work-life balance. \\nWe rolled out our gender-neutral parental leave \\npolicy, so every employee is guaranteed at least \\n14 weeks of paid leave. Combined with our existing \\nglobal flexible working policy, Sanofians can\\n\\nmore easily reconcile their personal lives \\nwith day-to-day work.\\n\\nAnd to make sure employee wellbeing stays \\na priority, last year we started the “All Well” \\nprogram—a one-stop-shop for financial, \\nphysical, mental, and social health resources. \\nIntegral to the approach is the Employee \\nAssistance Program, which allows Sanofians \\nto speak confidentially with a counselor, \\nday or night, any day of the year.\\n\\n Hear Sanofians Bruno and Pedro discuss \\nwhat Employee Resource Groups mean to them\\n\\nFolake Odediran, \\nGlobal Culture and Origins+ ERG lead \\nand Country Lead, Nigeria-Ghana\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cIntegrated Annual Report 2022 | Improving People’s Lives\\n\\n35\\n\\nPractical Tools for\\nan Accessible Workplace\\n\\nIn 2022, we examined every possible barrier to our employees \\nachieving their potential and then set out to remove them. \\n\\nEvery voice counts \\n\\nIn our second annual employee engagement \\nsurvey, our colleagues shared their opinions \\non how our organization is building a diverse \\nworkforce and creating an inclusive environment. \\nWe scored 8 out of 10 on our internal diversity \\nindex, so while we’ve made progress, we still have \\nwork to do before all our employees feel part of \\na representative and inclusive workplace.\\n\\nTo break down obstacles for our employees with \\ndisabilities, visible or invisible, we’re improving \\nphysical and digital accessibility. In 2022, we \\nconducted an accessibility audit of 100 sites to set \\nout the steps that will make all our locations fully \\naccessible by 2025. These range from ensuring \\nstep-free access for wheelchair users, to making \\nTadeo—a computer-assisted solution that helps \\ncommunication with people who are deaf or hard \\nof hearing—available to all employees. \\n\\nTo carry out the audit, we used a global accessibility \\nstandard co-developed by our Ability+ Employee \\nResource Group, facilities, safety, and DE&I \\nteams, and an external experience-design firm. \\nWe shared this standard with the Valuable 500, \\na collective of CEOs and companies working \\ntoward disability inclusion. \\n\\n Discover Raimunda’s story as a deaf \\nperson working at Sanofi\\n\\nAndria Cox,\\nHead of Learning Solutions - Medical Learning Institute\\nGlobal Ability+ ERG Lead\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cIntegrated Annual Report 2022 | Improving People’s Lives\\n\\n36\\n\\nChampioning DE&I:\\nIn and Beyond the Workplace\\n\\nWe advocate for DE&I for every employee and are now \\nextending that approach to our external stakeholders. \\n\\nWe want to have a positive social impact that \\ngoes beyond health and strengthens economic \\nengagement with the communities we serve. That’s \\nwhy we’re reshaping our supplier spending to \\ninclude more diverse communities.\\n\\nIn 2022, we launched a Global Supplier Diversity \\nProgram to increase our inclusion of marginalized \\ncommunities in our sourcing processes. It’s a \\nspringboard for change, helping us expand our \\nnetworks to include historically disadvantaged and \\nunderrepresented groups, while challenging our \\nprocurement team to look beyond the expected.\\n\\nWe made strides toward our goal of directing \\n€1.5 billion of our spending to small and diverse \\ncompanies by 2025 (€1.23 billion in 2022), and \\npublished our commitment to double our spend \\non businesses owned by women (up 33% in 2022 \\ncompared to 2021).
